<p>The Scientific Committee invites you to submit abstracts now for Late Breaking Free Papers.</p>



<h3>Meeting policy reminders:</h3>

<ul>

	<li>Abstracts that have been presented at other meetings may be submitted if they have not been published as a full research paper. </li>

	<li>Abstracts accepted must be unbiased and conflicts of interest must be declared. Abstracts will be non‐promotional in nature and without commercial bias. Papers that are written in a manner that promotes a company, service, or product will not be considered.</li>

	<li>All presenters of accepted abstracts are required to register for the conference. Fees are not reduced or waived for presenters. An alternate author should be prepared to attend and present if an emergency causes the primary author’s absence.</li>

</ul>



<h3>Expectations of abstract submissions:</h3>

<ul>

	<li>Each author listed on the abstract is required to complete a Financial Disclosure, which will be found in the “Presenters and Authors” section of the submission site.</li>

	<li>Abstracts should be submitted in English in “people-first” language and avoid potentially pejorative terms, such as “wheel-chair bound”, “afflicted”, or any other terms that may be deemed insensitive to persons with disabilities.</li>

	<li>It is expected that all research involving human subjects or animals has been approved by the appropriate ethical review committee.</li>

</ul>
