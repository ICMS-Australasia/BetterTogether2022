             <h3>Session description</h3>
             <p>This session will focus on different methodological approach to collect epidemiological data on cerebral palsy (CP) among children in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).</p>

             <p>There are limited population-based data on the epidemiology of cerebral palsy (CP) in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). In absence of national registers, ensuring data quality is challenging specially in resource constraint settings of LMICs. The researchers often need to be innovative and adopt different methods utilizing the limited available resources/infrastructure. In this session the presenters will discuss the strength and limitations of commonly used methods such as key informant method (KIM), Health and Demographic Surveillance System (HDDS), institution-based surveillance/clinical cohorts in studying the epidemiology of CP in LMIC settings. The discussion will help researchers/academicians and professionals working with children with disability toward attaining reliable data and support epidemiology studies in LMICs.</p>

             <h3>Session Outline</h3>
             <p>In this session three successful and replicable CP surveillance methods in LMICs would be highlighted; i. Community-based key informants’ method to collect data for the Bangladesh CP Register (BCPR), ii. Health and Demographic Surveillance System to conduct epidemiological studies on CP in Uganda, and iii. Paediatric Active Enhanced Disease Surveillance (PAEDS) mechanism to collect CP data in Hanoi, Vietnam.</p>

             <h3>Session description</h3>
             <p>In a UNICEF project on Early Identification and Intervention, a multidisciplinary international team of experts has come together to develop a comprehensive programme for children with developmental delay and disabilities. The project especially targets low and middle income countries with the ultimate aim to develop recommendations for universal health programs to be used nationally. As a first step this program will be piloted in three countries (Uganda, Peru, Bulgaria), each with unique implementation challenges.</p>
             <p>The UNICEF Project includes two tiers identifying and addressing the needs of all children with developmental delays, and will in a third tier provide additional assessments and individually targeted interventions for children identified as being at high risk for four common disabling developmental disorders (see title). Each of the four Tier III intervention groups has systematically reviewed the scientific literature to identify current best practice; formulated an implementation strategy; selected, organized, adapted and/or developed materials that will be utilized for staff training and for coaching caregivers in the delivery of the intervention. The program will be based on the family goals for intervention and on the child’s current capabilities as well as desired target behaviors.</p>

             `
             <h3>Session Description</h3>
             Children with Congenital Zika Syndrome (CZS) have clinical characteristics similar to Cerebral Palsy (CP), most of them presenting with severe motor impairments compatible with levels IV and V of the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS). Currently, more than 3,500 with CZS in Brazil are receiving rehabilitation interventions in public and/or private services, although little is known about the characteristics of the interventions delivered. As CZS is a new health condition, the lack of evidence-based guidelines has been a challenge to the implementation of evidence-based rehabilitation practices in low-and-middle income countries (LMIC). At the symposium, researchers from Brazilian and UK public institutions will discuss relevant aspects for the interventions models of children with CZS, from the diagnosis of CP, training of professionals, involvement of families as partners in research, barriers and facilitators for the implementation of evidence-based practices and intersectoral network focused on the families and participation as outcome.

             Session Outline:
             Chair, Antony Duttine will introduce the topics, speakers, format of the symposium and learning objectives. (10 minutes)

             P1, Alessandra Carvalho will provide a background of the published literature on CZS and the overlap with CP diagnosis. (10 minutes)

             P2, Ana Carolina de Campos will present results from a study mapping ICF domains and rehabilitation interventions provided to children with CZS in Brazil. (15 minutes)

             P3, Egmar Longo wil present the results of the Go Zika Go feasibility study, which aims to provide motorized mobility for children with CZS through the use of ride-on modified cars. (10 minutes)

             P4, Tracey Smythe will present results from two studies that evaluate the feasibility of establishing parent support groups for children with Congenital Zika Syndrome and their families in Brazil and Colombia. (15 minutes)

              Technical and innovative solutions can prevent, compensate, relieve activity limitations or participation restrictions. They can be of precious help in the rehabilitation process and during daily living, to overcome difficulties of children and youth with disabilities and their families. However, many needs remain unmet, thus accelerating the innovation process is warranted.

              This symposium, gathering families, engineers, health professionals presenters aims to:
              - share the innovation process and bring awareness to the interest of being involved in technology development process for disabled persons as engineers/technicians, persons with disabilities and their families and health professionals
              - demonstrate that innovation can be accelerated to more efficiently meet the needs of disabled persons through collaboration and co-construction between persons with disabilities and their families, engineers/ technicians, health professionals– in other words we are ‘better together’
              - show examples of such collaborations for innovation
              - promote inclusive innovation for the development of technological solutions for children with disabilities.

             SESSION DESCRIPTION:
             Infants born preterm are at an increased risk of adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes including cerebral palsy, autism spectrum disorder, and intellectual disability; amongst others. The impact of these conditions can be ameliorated by targeting interventions at a very young age, when neuroplasticity is greatest. Gaining a deeper understanding of normal and abnormal early brain development in the neonatal period is key to developing earlier predictors of outcomes, enabling early intervention and allowing assessment of the brain’s response.
             The preterm neonate undergoes rapid brain development in the postnatal period to term equivalent age. Neuroimaging, including MRI and EEG, provide valuable insights into brain injury, as well as structural and functional changes in this period. Clinical MRI identifies gross brain abnormalities indicative of adverse outcomes, and semi-quantitative approaches can be used to interrogate brain growth. Advanced MRI provides detailed insights into brain development, including changes in morphology (cortical folding, volumes of individual brain regions) and microstructure (myelination, organisation); while advanced EEG elucidates brain connectivity. Measures obtained from advanced MRI and EEG have shown to be associated with neurodevelopmental outcomes and could augment clinical MRI interpretation; however, translation into clinical practice remains challenging.
             This symposium brings together experts from clinical and research backgrounds from four countries (Australia, Italy, UK, USA) to present the current state of early brain neuroimaging, and discuss barriers and opportunities for translation into clinical practice.

             <h3>Session Description</h3>
             The COVID-19 Pandemic has influenced families, caregivers, health care providers and children with disabilities around the globe. As an international task force of over 50 health care providers from over 30 countries, we teamed together to create the IAACD COVID-19 Task Force. Three working subgroups were organized as follows: Listening and Sharing sessions, Resources and Surveys. As we met throughout the pandemic, our unified understanding of the impact and the means to cope and recover through this challenge provided pivotal examples of worldwide comparisons and contrasts. By understanding the impact, we can further understand the opportunities for improvement to promote the health and rights of children with disabilities and their support systems through and beyond COVID-19. This focused symposium will consist of a series of trans-disciplinary and international presentations. Attendees will engage in active discussions about that which each of the three subgroups within the Task Force developed and learned.

             `
             Although classified as a disorder of movement, Cerebral Palsy has frequent overlap with other neurodevelopmental conditions, including seizures, autism and intellectual disability. Recent studies indicate that about 30% of people with Cerebral Palsy have a genetic contribution to their condition. Using genomic tools to understand cerebral palsy will provide direct benefits to clinicians, researchers, other professionals and carers of individuals affected by neurological disability.
              In the emerging era of precision medicine, where therapies are increasingly tailored to an individual genomic variation, this development will eventually lead to personalized therapy. We imaging that this may be as the use of appropriate pharmaceutical or neutraceutical agents or by predicting that a syndrome may recur and counselling accordingly.
              Derived from the genomics are model systems that allow an exploration of the mechanisms that underlay cerebral palsy. These tools also provide an understanding of the genetic and cellular networks that underpin cerebral plays and therefore provide novel avenues to therapies.
              Epigenetics is the study of how the environment influences gene expression. In cerebral palsy, where conditional exposure may explain a difference in presentation, these tools extend our understanding of the condition.
              This symposium will collect national and international experts from a diverse range of countries, experience and gender (TBC). Our team will present on state of the art in CP genomics. Importantly, about the emerging data suggesting when and what testing should be undertaken in the clinical space. We will discuss how model systems including yeast, fly and zebrafish inform our understanding of CP. Also how they can be used to understand networks and pathways. We will discuss what we can learn from epigenetic studies. Finally, the team will discuss whether genetic information could assist with developing new treatments for CP.

             Evidence for contemporary models of upper limb therapy in children with unilateral cerebral palsy (uCP) is well established (Novak & Honan, 2019). The consistent ingredient across all models includes the implementation of therapeutic strategies that are guided by motor learning theory. Practice is meaningful, goal-directed and task-specific (Beckers et al., 2020). The dosage is sufficient to enable learning and drive neuroplasticity (Jackman et al. 2020) and can be applied in an intensive or distributed model.
             Despite these consistencies, there is growing recognition that significant differences exist in the guiding motor learning theories for each model and the strategies used to operationalize these theories. This is largely due to the fact that there is no “motor learning model” (Gentile, 1992).Multiple theories inform our understanding and interpretation of skill acquisition. These interpretations are also highly influenced by other discipline specific frames of reference.
             The delivery of carefully considered and timely therapeutic actions remains very complex. Our observable therapeutic actions, including the selection and manipulation of tasks, practice, and feedback conditions can improve or interfere with learning and generalization of skills. We propose that constructive discussion is needed about the complexity of motor learning theory, rather than focus on dosage, to advance the field (Hoare, 2020). This will enable more accurate comparisons between therapy approaches and assist in maintaining treatment fidelity for the implementation of evidence-based approaches into clinical practice.
             In this session, developers of various models of bimanual therapy will use a newly developed motor learning documentation tool to describe the unique features of each model, highlighting how the guiding motor learning theories have been operationalized.

             <h3>Session Description</h3>
             Participation in valued life situations is key in promoting health and wellbeing in childhood-onset disability. Evidence for sound measures of participation and effective intervention strategies to improve participation exists, but practice is slow to change. A new international movement called LEAP (Leading Evidence to Advance Participation-focused practice) aims to address this pressing ‘knowledge-to-practice’ gap. LEAP comprises diverse researchers and stakeholders whose purpose is to seek meaningful collaborations to jointly- transform practice towards a focus on participation. For this purpose, effective Knowledge Translation (KT) implementation methods are developed and shared internationally.

             This symposium will introduce a structured Participation-focused KT roadmap (P-KT) to guide all stakeholders interested in fostering a shift in practice. Specifically, a systematic and collaborative multi-level P-KT framework involving a ‘family-clinician-manager-community leader-policymaker’ synergy will be presented. The P-KT framework considers micro (client/family, service providers), meso (organizations such as rehabilitation centers, hospitals, schools, community agencies) and macro (local and governmental policy and regulatory bodies community, sociocultural context) ecological levels, and provides eight principles for enabling the uptake of participation-focused innovations. Common issues experienced when implementing participation-focused practice, paired with examples of solutions-based strategies to facilitate ‘readiness for change’ and ‘knowledge uptake’ will be discussed.  Identifying Who should be considered, What is needed and How to foster change are essential elements that will be presented. The approach will be illustrated through case examples from different contexts in both high and low resource settings such as Canada, The Netherlands, South Africa and India. The ultimate goal of the symposium is to LEAP together to bring about substantial change in practice behaviours, and consequently, in children’s outcomes.

             <h3>Session Description</h3>
             Knowledge translation (KT) from research to clinical practice and implementation of evidence-based practice is often hindered by a number of barriers. The complexity of scientific language and the applicability of research that is generated largely in high income countries may be important barriers for the effective application of knowledge. Children with CP and their families often do not have access to the latest scientific evidence, or may have a limited understanding of what is applicable to their reality. In many low-and-middle incoming countries (LMIC), as those in Latin-American, there are added barriers to KT to include the actual language in which most scientific evidence is published (English), and the challenges in applying research produced in high income countries to the sociodemographic characteristics of the population, and the limited financial and professional training capacity of health and rehabilitation services and professionals.

             This focused symposium will consist of a series of transdisciplinary presentations sharing some solutions for breaking barriers to KT, particularly in LMIC, using the example of one KT organization in Brazil. Attendees will be invited to contribute with challenges encountered in their context and to discuss solutions that can be replicated and foster international collaborations.

             Session Outline:

             1. PR - Chair (10 minutes): PR will introduce the topics, speakers, and introduce examples of organisations developing powerful actions of  KT in collaboration with different institutions and active participation of individuals with disabilities.

             <h3>Session Description</h3>
             The F-Words for Child Development are built upon the World Health Organization’s International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) framework.  First published in 2012 (Rosenbaum & Gorter), the F-words framework encourages us to concentrate on six words that should be the focus of thinking in the field of childhood disability: Function, Family, Fitness, Fun, Friends and Future. Initial efforts to raise awareness of the F-words included development of videos, posters and tools that can be used by families. These F-words materials are now available in more than 25 languages, illustrating the international appeal of these ideas. More recently, the CanChild F-words Team has partnered with clinician colleagues across the world to explore how the F-words can be implemented, and the impact that this conceptual approach has on families and service delivery. In this Symposium, we will use the Knowledge to Action Cycle to explore these implementation efforts in three diverse countries. Adaptations for the local context, practical strategies and lessons learned will be presented to support F-words implementation in a variety of practice settings.

             Session Outline
             Chair: Peter Rosenbaum from CanChild (Canada) will introduce the presenters and the F-words for Child Development.
             Presenter 1: Danijela Grahovac from CanChild (Canada) will outline how and why the F-words are important for children’s developmental services from her unique perspective as a member of the F-words Team and parent of a youth with cerebral palsy.
             Presenter 2: Rachel Teplicky from CanChild (Canada) will present key implementation science concepts and will introduce the Knowledge to Action Cycle.
             Presenters 3: Marina Airoldi and Beatriz Vieira from Nossa Casa (Brazil) will share their experience with raising awareness of the F-words in Brazil by developing knowledge tools, understanding the local context and designing interventions to move the F-words into practice.
             Presenters 4: Arul Hamill and Lucy Charles from Paediatric Occupational Therapy (New Zealand) will discuss the implementation of the F-words in combination with a coaching approach: The F-Words Life Wheel which facilitates meaningful conversations and goal setting with families and children.

             OUTLINE:
             A key aim of intervention is to optimise neuroplasticity in infants at risk of Cerebral Palsy and children with Cerebral Palsy in response to effective interventions.  Previous approaches to classifying brain structure use qualitative approaches, which rely on expert knowledge of the radiologist or neurologist to classify brain MRI structure in broad predominant groups (WMI, GMI, Brain malformations), which are highly correlated with presumed timing of the brain injury.  Other semi-quantitative approaches focus on brain lesion severity (Fiori scale).
             One of the key innovations in measuring the relationship between brain structure and function in children with early brain injury is automated analysis.  This enables clinicians and researchers the opportunity to measure quantitative brain structure and the relationship to motor, upper limb, cognitive and visual outcomes.  Recently there has been a move towards the automated analysis of brain structure, allowing for prediction modelling of long-term patient outcomes, and potentially incorporating genetic information. Making these analyses available in the clinical setting can revolutionize personalized medicine for children with cerebral palsy.
             This symposium brings together experiences from four countries (Australia, Italy, Spain and USA) where researchers and clinicians have implemented brain structure and function measures for children with CP. The objective of this symposia is to describe (i) the various approaches to measuring brain structure and function (psychological, motor, sensory) in infants at risk and children with CP; (ii) examples of measuring brain structure and reorganization; (iii) innovations in automated approaches available for clinicians and researchers and (iv) challenges encountered and how these are overcome.

             <h3>Session Description</h3>
             Increasing neuroplasticity to optimize response to interventions can improve cost-effectiveness in neurorehabilitation. There is a growing interest in inducing functional plastic changes in adults and children with neurodisability using non-invasive neuromodulation techniques (such as repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation, rTMS, and Transcranial Electrical Stimulation, TES). Neuromodulation is used in conjunction with rehabilitation strategies in order to prime or enhance endogenous neuroplasticity activated by training in the desired learned behaviour in order to optimize developmental trajectories. rTMS can be used to either upregulate neural activity or downregulate neural activity in the stimulated region. This is particularly useful when targeting regions (or nodes) of brain networks known to be either underactive or overactive in particular disease states. For example, rTMS is used to stimulate underactive left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in treatment-resistant depression; and downregulate excessive activity in the supplementary motor area in Tourette’s disorder.

             Session Outline
             This focused symposium will discuss the latest research into boosting cognitive and sensorimotor rehabilitation in a variety of neurodisabilities including cerebral palsy, traumatic brain injury, stroke and autistic spectrum disorder. The important issue of efficacy and safety of using these techniques in pediatric populations will be discussed.
             •	Prof Enticott: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation to improve social communication in autistic spectrum disorder. TMS has been used to investigate the neurophysiology of ASD. Prof Enticott will discuss the use of rTMS as a potential treatment to improve social communication in ASD in the context of its neurobiology and his current multicentre RCT.
             •	Prof Adam Kirton: Brain stimulation to optimize outcomes after perinatal stroke. Brain injury at the start of life derails development with lifelong consequences. Perinatal stroke accounts for most hemiparetic cerebral palsy (CP). Noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) to potentially optimize developmental trajectories toward better outcomes. Dr. Kirton will discuss the use of rTMS and TES for the treatment of hemiparesis in childhood stroke
             •	Prof Karen Barlow: Non-invasive neuromodulation to improve neurodevelopment following acquired brain injury. Neuropsychological outcomes after acquired brain injury are poor yet only 17% of children receive cognitive rehabilitation. Professor Barlow will discuss how rTMS and TES offer potential to enhance traditional rehabilitation strategies and improve outcomes.

             <h3>Session Description :</h3>
              Laboratory-based optical motion capture is the current gold standard for clinical motion analysis, but expensive and time consuming. It may fail to capture how individuals move in natural settings. Markerless motion capture is now feasible with availability of large-scale computing power and recent developments in image-based analysis using deep learning approaches. Modern computational methods, along with large publicly available datasets has enabled the development of algorithms for human pose estimation from videos and images, such as OpenPose and DeepLabCut. These provide the opportunity for biomechanical analysis outside the laboratory. This session will provide an international perspective on the use of markerless motion capture in various paediatric settings, presented by a diverse team from four continents (Asia, Australia, Europe and Africa) and with a variety of backgrounds.
              Session Outline:
              1.	AB, a chair (5 minutes) will introduce the topic, speakers and facilitate discussion.
              2.	AB and HH (15minutes) will introduce their work on automatic video tracking using deep learning in children with dyskinetic CP. The work is aimed at improving assessment and classification of the movement disorders present in dyskinetic CP, quantifying them, mainly to improve indication and evaluation of treatment.
              3.	EP (15 minutes) will present her work exploring the use of markerless motion capture of infants from smart phone videos. This will address some of the additional challenges in performing movement tracking from videos recorded outside of the laboratory setting. EP will present on the use of this movement data to predict the general movements assessment in preterm and term infants using machine learning approaches.
              4.	NL (15 minutes) will introduce their work on markerless tracking and analyses of the upper limb movement during gait in children with spastic diplegia due to HIV encephalopathy. The analyses are based on 2D gait videos and DeepLabCut machine learning algorithms, resulting in shoulder and elbow joint angles reported over a gait cycle. NL will present the feasibility of this novel method as well the outcome of the upper limb movement study in children with HIV encephalopathy and spastic diplegia compared to typically developing children.
              5.	DR (15 minutes) will introduce the visual classification of abnormal gait pattern in spastic CP and compare to 3D gait analyses in regarding categorization. DR will present the validity of automated gait classification from 2D gait videos in children with spastic CP using OpenPose and Deep Learning algorithm.

             `
             The development and implementation of robotic technology in Neurorehabilitation has increased dramatically in recent years.  The use of robotics to enhance mobility began with the development and commercialization of the LOKOMAT in 1994.  The application of robotics has grown in recent years to locomotion, arm motion, trunk control, head control, and others.
             However, robotic devices are not without controversy as many have failed to demonstrate superiority to current evidence-based therapies.  Several devices have emerged recently to enhance mobility in cerebral palsy, and have demonstrated promising preliminary evidence of effectiveness as both assistive and training devices.  More recent devices often have more sophisticated control systems that challenge or perturb users according to biomechanical and motor learning principles.  Devices available for clinic or even home use or fully wearable exoskeletons are also becoming more prominent.  However, many technological and implementation challenges remain especially when considering the global rehabilitation community.
             This symposium aims to:
             1.	Present an overview of the current state of the science in robotics to enhance mobility in CP from a broad international perspective.  We will provide examples of emerging technologies that address a range of functional goals and abilities in CP from walking to trunk control during sitting.
             2.	Discuss the critical need for a multidisciplinary team when developing robotics for neurorehabilitation.  In addition to highly technical engineering skill, knowledge of motor learning principles and neuroplasticity is also necessary in the design and implementation.
             3.	Generate discussion on still unresolved questions and challenges in the field, e.g.:  1) does robotics offer something beyond other evidence-based therapies?; 2)  what additional  aspects must be addressed in terms of device development?;  3) Are these devices worth the expense and effort?;  and perhaps most importantly for this context: 4) what is their utility from a global perspective?  Can these be used in or adapted for lower resource settings?
             Format:  We will have four speakers from different world regions and disciplines involved in robotics research, development and implementation. Each speaker will discuss their perspective on this topic, provide real world examples, and discuss potential benefits and challenges.

             <h3>Session Description  Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most common childhood motor disability often resulting in debilitating walking abnormalities, such as flexed-knee and stiff-knee gait. Currently treatments are partially effective but may cause significant muscle weakness. Emerging technologies and applications of neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) can potentially improve strength, tone, and mobility. NMES can promote strength to improve upper and lower limb mobility.</h3> Pre- and post-operative NMES can be used for strengthening to improve function for children undergoing orthopaedic surgery. NMES can also be applied for tone management of children with dyskinetic and spastic CP. Multichannel NMES applied during cycling and treadmill training can promote mobility in children with spastic CP. Wearable sensor-controlled multichannel NMES devices are being developed to provide real-time biomechanical support and sensory input during reach and gait. The objective of this symposium, presented by international research teams, is to introduce the concepts, technologies, and protocols for clinical application of multichannel NMES for strengthening, tone management, reach, and gait for children with CP. Development of wearable multichannel NMES can leverage lightweight wireless stimulators and advanced control design to activate upper and lower limb muscles non-invasively using surface electrodes. These technologies offer promising interventions that can be implemented to improve mobility at home and in the community for individuals living in high or low resource settings worldwide. Evidence-based outcomes will be discussed to determine immediate neuroprosthetic effects and longer-term neurotherapeutic effects of these emerging applications for children with CP.

             <h3>Session Description</h3>

             Reviews of efficacious treatment approaches for children with cerebral palsy (CP) indicate two commonalities: 1) use of "motor learning-based treatment approach," and 2) sufficient intensity of treatment. However careful examination of the literature reveals that the term "Motor Learning Treatment Approach" is rarely qualified with sufficient description. We will describe what a "Motor Learning-based Treatment Approach" is, including the minimum common requirements and various interpretations and examples of implementation across different sites and ages. We bring together three unique teams to discuss their interpretations and provide examples, with focus on the commonalities and differences of opinion and practice, and how improved function relates to "Better Together."

             Session Outline

             General Introduction of the theme and speakers-(10 min) (Andrew Gordon)

             Andrew Gordon, Phd (15min). "Motor learning approach and its application to seated postural control interventions." He will provide a history of the approach, describe how it differs from other approaches, and propose a minimum set of criteria required for a treatment to be considered consistent with this approach. He will then provide examples from recent seated postural control interventions for children with bilateral CP.

             Yannick Bleyenheuft, PT, PhD (15min). "Intensive therapy using a motor learning approach targeted toward the lower extremities."  She will describe how these concepts are applied during Hand-Arm Bimanual Intensive Therapy Including the Lower Extremities (HABIT-ILE), with an emphasis on targeting postural control and lower extremity function.

             Leanne Sakzewski, PT, PhD (15min). "Targeting upper extremity improvements embedding motor learning concepts with CIMT."  She will describe what it means to provide intensive motor learning approaches and will describe how these concepts are applied during group based CIMT, hybrid CIMT with an emphasis on targeting improvements in upper extremity function and attainment of occupational performance goals.

             General discussion (20min) We will discuss commonalities and differences of our interpretations.

             <h3>Session Description</h3>
             The symposium will provide an overview of current best practice in the identification of Cerebral Visual Impairment (CVI) and in devising intervention in infants and children with cerebral palsy. Underlying mechanisms of CVI will be explored by elucidating brain-behaviour correlates in the light of the specific mechanisms of plasticity in the visual brain. Strengths and limitation of current tools to assess visual functions and functional vision in infants and children will be described, within the framework of ICF and the recently developed Visual Function Classification System (VFCS). Best evidence of early intervention in infants at risk of CP with CVI will be covered, including the importance of addressing visual difficulties in the context of structured rehabilitation programs based on environmental enrichment and motor learning.
             At completion of the symposium, participants will:
             (i)	Increase awareness of the visual difficulties experienced by infants and children with CP;
             (ii)	Understand the relationship between brain structure, visual function and reorganisation;
             (iii)	Develop uniformity in definition and evaluation of CVI, by having knowledge of the best tools used for the assessment of visual functions in infants and children with CP;
             (iv)	Have an understanding of the principles of vision-aware intervention in infants and children with CP, including the knowledge of their limitations and expected outcomes;

             Session Outline:
