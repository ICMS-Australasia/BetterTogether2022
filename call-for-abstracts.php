 <p>The Scientific Committee invites you to submit abstracts now for scientific free papers, posters, instructional courses, breakfast seminars, PhD platforms and other presentation types. We encourage multi-centre, multi-country submissions from both high and low resource settings. This will be a hybrid conference and presenters can plan to attend in person or virtually. We welcome in-person, virtual and hybrid presentations. This does not need to be specified at the time of your submission.</p>
 <p>To accommodate a hybrid conference format, all presenters are asked to consider how best to engage with both virtual and in-person attendees within their sessions to ensure an effective learning opportunity is provided. This is particularly important for breakfast seminars and instructional courses.</p>
 <h2>Meeting policy reminders:</h2>
 <ul>
   <li>Abstracts that have been presented at other meetings may be submitted if they have not been published as a full research paper.</li>
   <li>Abstracts accepted must be unbiased and conflicts of interest must be declared. Abstracts will be non‐promotional in nature and without commercial bias. Papers that are written in a manner that promotes a company, service, or product will not be considered.</li>
   <li>All presenters of accepted abstracts are required to register for the conference (in person or virtual). Fees are not reduced or waived for presenters. An alternate author should be prepared to attend and present if an emergency causes the primary author’s absence.</li>
 </ul>

 <h2>Expectations of abstract submissions:</h2>
 <ul>
   <li>Each author listed on the abstract is required to complete a Financial Disclosure, which will be found in the “Presenters and Authors” section of the submission site.</li>
   <li>Abstracts should be submitted in English in “people-first” language and avoid potentially pejorative terms, such as “wheel-chair bound”, “afflicted”, or any other terms that may be deemed insensitive to persons with disabilities.</li>
   <li>It is expected that all research involving human subjects or animals has been approved by the appropriate ethical review committee.</li>
 </ul>

 <p>Members of the Better Together 2022 Scientific Program Committee will review the abstracts, blinded to the names of the authors and institutions affiliated with the submission. Presentations will be selected on the basis of their quality, relevance and impact determined by review of the research question or hypothesis, study design, methodology, conclusions, impact/relevance and importance as described in the abstract. Student status of the author will not affect the abstract submission type or the grading of the abstract.</p>

 <h2>Presentation Types</h2>
 <p>The Scientific Program Committee determines the presentation format of scientific presentations after review and selection. In order to make fair comparisons of the quality of submitted abstracts across a wide spectrum of disciplines, it is imperative that the format of a structured abstract be followed. A strict 400 word count, will be imposed on the length of the body of the abstract.</p>
 <p>The presentation types available are, also linked to their individual templates with specific guidelines:</p>
