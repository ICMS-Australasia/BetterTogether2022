<h2>Discover Australia</h2>
<h4 class="mt-0">Australia is a land of many opportunities for visitors.</h4>
<p>Australia contains a breathtaking diversity of natural landscapes from the snow-capped mountains of the Southern Alps to the lush rainforests of the tropical north, and from the spectacular surf beaches of the coast to the wide-open spaces of the Australian Outback. No visit would be complete without exploring some of Australia’s natural heritage icons, such as the Great Barrier Reef, Kakadu National Park and Uluru.</p>
<p>Just as distinct are Australia’s cities, where our laid-back lifestyle and cosmopolitan culture meet. You will find a melting pot of cultures and a medley of theatre, restaurants, nightlife and events. Come, stay and celebrate, then spring into the rest of your Australian holiday. Australia has so much for you to explore, whether you want nature, wildlife, outback adventure, islands, rainforest or reef. Australia’s unique beauty is spread across eight states and territories, so find out more about the distinct attractions within each:</p>
