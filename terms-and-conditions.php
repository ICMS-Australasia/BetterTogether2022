 <!-- <h2>Cancellation Policy</h2>
 <h3>Deadline: 1 January 2022</h3>
 <p>Cancellations must be notified in writing (e-mail is sufficient) to the Conference Secretariat. Cancellations made by 1 January 2022 will result in a full refund less $150 to cover administration costs. As an alternative to cancellation, your registration may be transferred to another person by 1 January 2022 without incurring any cost penalty. There will be no cancellation allowance for failure to secure a visa to Australia. There will be no refunds for Virtual registrations. In the event of the Conference becoming completely virtual the delegate will receive a refund of the difference between the in-person and virtual cost. Delegates can pay the difference to upgrade from a virtual registration to the equivalent in-person registration at any time without incurring any cost penalty. Delegates must note that some social functions may reach their capacity limits and tickets are only guaranteed on a first come first served basis. The Conference Secretariat must be advised in writing of any alterations or transfers. The Organising Committee reserves final decision on a case by case basis for granting a cancellation in extenuating circumstances. It is recommended that travel insurance be secured personally upon registration.</p>
-->
 <p> Once your registration has been completed, there will be no refunds available. The Conference content will remain online and active for 3 months post Conference and remain accessible for registered delegates to view at any time during this period. Your registration may be transferred to another person by 1 January 2022. The Conference Secretariat must be advised in writing of any alternations or transfers by this date.</p>

 <!-- <h2>Accommodation Cancellations</h2>
 <h3>Deadline: 24 January 2022</h3>
 <p>No accommodation payments will be refunded on or after Friday 24 January 2022. <br>
   Participants who confirm an accommodation booking with a credit card or full pre-payment and who wish to cancel on or after Friday 24 January 2022 are liable for the full cost of their accommodation nights cancelled. To cancel your reservation, please contact The Accommodation Secretariat at <a href="mailto:accommodation@bettertogether2022.org">accommodation@bettertogether2022.org</a>. Name changes to a reservation can be made at no charge.</p>
 <p>Delegates who confirm attendance by paying a minimum of the first night and do not advise of cancellation before 24 January 2022 the ‘no show’ rate, as penalised by the hotel, will be charged to you and your payment will not be refunded. This charge is calculated as the room rate per night multiplied by the dates booked and secured. Please ensure that accommodation dates are correct at time of booking and before 24 January 2022 if any changes are required.</p>

 <h3>Change of accommodation booking</h3>
 <p>Any change in booking must be made in writing to the Conference Secretariat and NOT directly to the hotel before 24 January 2022. Any changes received after 24 January 2022 will be at the hotels discretion and based on availability.</p>

 <h3>Early arrival</h3>
 <p>As check in at most hotels is not until 1400, it is possible that your room may not be ready for immediate occupation on your early arrival. Whilst hotels will do everything possible to accommodate early arrivals, if you wish to be guaranteed immediate occupation you can pay an extra day’s tariff for the night before you are due to arrive. If you wish to take this precaution, please advise the Conference Secretariat so we can notify the hotel that your room is required early.</p>

 <h3>Late arrival</h3>
 <p>Please indicate if you will arrive at your hotel after 1800. Failure to do so might result in your room being released.</p> -->
