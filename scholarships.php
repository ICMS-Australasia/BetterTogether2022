<p>A recent announcement made by the Conference Organising Committee informed members that the Better Together 2022 Conference has now been moved to a fully virtual Conference in March 2022. As a result of this, ALL scholarships awarded will be for virtual registration only.</p>
<p>If you have already applied for an in-person scholarship, it will automatically be converted to a virtual scholarship application. Applicants will be notified of their outcome by 31 October 2021</p>
<p>With the change to a fully virtual conference, there will be a second opportunity to apply for scholarships in December. The Better Together 2022 website will give further updates on this in the coming months.</p>
