<h2>What to pack</h2>
<h3>Climate</h3>
 <p>Melbourne has a reputation for its changeable weather. A tip for any visitor is to be prepared for anything – wear layers that can be worn or removed as needed. The average temperature for Melbourne in March ranges from 15°C to 24°C but in true Melbourne form can be unpredictable and be much lower or much higher than the average. A full range of weather may be experienced within a few days, from calm and sunny to cold, windy and showery.</p>

<h2>Free Tram Zone</h2>
 <p>The Free Tram Zone in Melbourne's CBD makes it easier for commuters and tourists to move around the city. The principal boundaries of the Free Tram Zone are Spring Street, Flinders Street and La Trobe Street. Additionally, the tram routes along Victoria Street, William Street and Elizabeth Street that surround Victoria Market are also included as well as the Docklands area. All stops within the zone are clearly marked and tram drivers will make regular announcements when approaching the zone boundaries. Zone boundaries are signed and free tram zone maps are across the network. If your tram journey is exclusively within the zone, travel is free, meaning you do not need to touch on with a myki. If your journey begins or ends outside of the zone you must touch on with a valid myki when boarding the tram.</p>
