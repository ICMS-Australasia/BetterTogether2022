<p>Recognizing the importance of professional societies, and appreciating the global gap in access to this expertise, the three Founding Academies (American Academy for Cerebral Palsy and Developmental Medicine, European Academy of Childhood Disability and Australasian Academy of Cerebral Palsy and Developmental Medicine) agreed to establish an alliance of developmental disability associations. The hope was that this alliance would combine individual strengths and support the creation of national and regional academies. These in turn would promote the development of professional capacity â€“ being accessible by families and policy makers and sensitive to the cultural, social, geographic and political realities of their country or region.</p>
<p>Our success will be determined by the extent to which families can reach the networks of services that they and their children need to support their pathway of development, no matter the nature of their disability or where they live across the globe.</p>
