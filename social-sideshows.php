<h2>Networking</h2>

<p>Although the Conference has moved fully virtual, the organisers still encourage you to participate in the networking elements to get the most out of the social aspect of the event. </p>

<h3>Names, Games & Rock’n’Roll</h3>
<p>To assist in accommodating all timezones, the organisers are planning two exciting Welcome Receptions. These functions are going to be high-energy and a lot of fun and everyone is encouraged to attend at least one. </p>

<p>Names, Games & Rock n Roll is an engaging and fun-filled session that combines your love of music, games & general knowledge in a laugh out loud, virtual event. There is something for everyone to enjoy in these interactive sessions including trivia, live music performed by Brihony and their talented team and plenty of themed games to give attendees back their spark, learn hidden skills and connect like you never have before.</p>

<h3>Ask Me Anything Sessions</h3>
<p>These interactive sessions will be a fantastic opportunity to meet the keynotes and “ask them anything” in a low-pressure, informal environment. These sessions will be great for early career researchers and anyone looking to further discuss information from the presentations and/or posters.</p>

<h3>Networking</h3>
<p>The virtual Conference platform will include an in-app messaging chat for you to connect with other delegates, take the opportunity to reach out to people to further discuss their presentations, posters or just for a catch-up chat.</p>

<h2>Feel Good Sessions</h2>
<p>On each day of the conference, one feel good session has been scheduled. These sessions are short 10-minute breaks from the scientific program and aim to put a smile on your face.</p>
