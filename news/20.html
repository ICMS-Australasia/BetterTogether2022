        <p>Happy New Year from the Better Together 2022 team! We hope you were able to take some time for yourself and spend some quality time with your family and friends. With the New Year we reflect on the recent struggles that we know people have faced and look towards what we hope is the light at the end of the pandemic tunnel.</p>
        <p>The Conference Organising team is now back from holidays and in full planning mode for the final home stretch of the Conference lead-up. Although we will not be together in-person we can assure you that we are putting together an engaging and interactive program with some special touches not to be missed. This Conference aims to bring together clinicians, researchers, people with disability, families, carers, support workers and many others to share knowledge about childhood onset disability.</p>
        <h3>New Conference Flyer</h3>
        <p>As part of the conference promotional campaign, we invite enthusiastic industry and academy representatives to help spread the word about the Conference. A two page flyer has been created to assist you in getting the message out there and encourage people to register, click on the following link to view and download the flyer.</p>
