        <h3>Sunday 10 October 2021</h3>

        <p>The overall objective of World Mental Health Day is to raise awareness of mental health issues around the world and to mobilise efforts in support of mental health.</p>

        <p><em>“Look up, look out & look forward”</em> - <a href="https://lookafteryourmentalhealthaustralia.org.au/" target="_blank">Mental Health Australia</a></p>

        <p>Due to COVID-19 the Better Together 2022 Organising Committee made the decision to move to a fully virtual Conference in March 2022. This is a challenging time with lockdowns, social distancing and border closures and we understand that although this Conference is fully virtual, considerations need to be made to ensure peoples’ health and wellbeing.</p>
        <p>We are pleased to provide an insight into our planning and announce the Conferences’ new initative The Feel Good Corner! This will be an exciting resource gallery to assist in looking after yourself both mentally and physically during the Conference, as well as having the opportunity to ‘virtually’ visit Melbourne and its surrounds.</p>
        <p>Keep an eye out for the Feel Good Pop-up Sessions, there is one each day!</p>
