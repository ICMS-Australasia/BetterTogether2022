	<p><strong>Objectives: </strong><br>
1. Participants will explain the current level of evidence of long-term outcomes of gait in adults in cerebral palsy.<br>
  2. Participants will explain the current evidence of expected outcomes in adults with CP regarding quality of life, physical function, depression, and pain.<br>
  3. Participants will explain the current evidence of expected levels of walking activity in adults with CP and the impact activity will have on health.</p>
<p><strong>Summary: </strong> </p>
<p>Advances in pediatric orthopedic care over the past three decades have improved mobility, function, and quality of life for children and youth with cerebral palsy (CP). The long-term effectiveness of this care into adulthood has not been widely reported. Some studies demonstrate gait outcomes in young adults with CP that show walking mechanics are largely unchanged from adolescence, but the relationship of gait outcomes to walking activity and pain in adulthood is unknown. Walking with persistent gait deviations increases energy cost, produces fatigue, and may lead to joint pain and degenerative joint disease in the long-term.</p>
<p>The purpose of this course is to review the relevant literature of gait and functional outcomes of adults with CP, to discuss the difficulties and challenges of long-term follow-up studies in this population, and to describe in detail a recent investigation that measures long-term outcomes of gait, physical function, mental well-being, walking activity and pain in a cohort of adults with CP who received specialized pediatric orthopedic care as children and adolescents.  Factors that impact outcomes in adults with CP and their implications for pediatric treatment, education for transition to adulthood, and adult treatment will be discussed.</p>
<p><strong>Interactive Element:</strong> <br>
The final 30 minutes of the course will be an interactive presentation of case studies of the outcomes of adults with CP and their childhood development.  We will seek in-person and virtual feedback regarding expected outcomes, key treatment recommendations, and factors that impact gait and functional mobility in adults with CP. </p>
<p>Target Audience: Providers involved in the care of children or adults with CP.</p>

	<p><strong>Session Description: </strong><br>
Children with Congenital Zika Syndrome (CZS) have clinical characteristics similar to Cerebral Palsy (CP), most of them presenting with severe motor impairments compatible with levels IV and V of the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS). Currently, more than 3,500 with CZS in Brazil are receiving rehabilitation interventions in public and/or private services, although little is known about the characteristics of the interventions delivered. As CZS is a new health condition, the lack of evidence-based guidelines has been a challenge to the implementation of evidence-based rehabilitation practices in low-and-middle income countries (LMIC). At the symposium, researchers from Brazilian and UK public institutions will discuss relevant aspects for the interventions models of children with CZS, from the diagnosis of CP, training of professionals, involvement of families as partners in research, barriers and facilitators for the implementation of evidence-based practices and intersectoral network focused on the families and participation as outcome.</p>
<p><strong>Session Outline:</strong> <br>

	<p><strong>Session description:</strong><br>
	The lack of access to rehabilitation and support services for children with disabilities in resource-constrained settings has been well-documented. Less well-described are evidence-based solutions which address this challenge.  The utilization of non-professionals (lay workers and community-based rehabilitation workers) in community-based rehabilitation programmes to support and train caregivers and families of children with CP is a common strategy in lower and middle-income countries (LMICs).</p>
	<p>More recently, there has been a move towards task-shifting the role of trainer to parents themselves. With their lived experience of parenting a child with a disability, parents who receive specialised training which enables them to train other parents are viewed as legitimate and credible sources of information. Benefits of a parent-led programme include informed and empowered caregivers, a decrease in stigma and self-blame, an increase in caregiver self-confidence and acceptance, and improved access to rehabilitation services.</p>
	<p>However, for a parent-led training programme to be effective, several challenges need to be overcome. These include fidelity to the programme; quality assurance; sustainability of a donor-funded programme; mentoring and supervision; literacy levels; translation and adaptation of materials; and transport constraints. </p>
	<p>This symposium focuses on the implementation of four parent-led training programmes in resource- constrained settings. Presenters will describe the training and implementation approach of each programme, to preface a discussion of the cross-cutting challenges outlined above. </p>

	<p><strong>Session description</strong><br>
Approximately 53 million children have disabilities globally, 95% of whom reside in Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMIC) with increased mortality, morbidity, poorer access to healthcare/ education and increased risk of abuse/ neglect.  The Sustainable Development Goals aim to ensure that all children are supported to reach their developmental potential; and the WHO-UNICEF Nurturing Care Framework for Early Child Development, provides a policy framework towards this. </p>
<p>Despite recent progress in epidemiological research in LMICs, there are significant evidence gaps in ensuring children with disabilities in LMIC have equal opportunities and thrive. We argue that research methodologies to explore important questions related to this gap are under-developed. The implementation research methodologies in global child development require adaptation to ensure they are inclusive of children with disabilities and their families, participatory and meaningfully measure implementation process and intervention impact across settings. In this symposium, using exemplars from diverse settings, we ask how can we strengthen research methods to better understand how to help children with disabilities in LMIC thrive?<br>
  Aim: To share experiences and explore opportunities to strengthen implementation research for children with disabilities in LMIC.<br>
  <br>
</p>
<p> <strong>Objectives:</strong><br>
I.	Consider key research methods, informed by clinical and implementation science, for conducting research in child development/ disability in LMICs (including approaches for measuring process and impact). <br>
  II.	Reflect on practical experiences from completed/ ongoing trials in Asia Pacific region and the evaluation of the Saving Brains child development portfolio including lessons learned; and opportunities and challenges for strengthened research methods moving forwards. <br>
  III.	Explore a framework for future research in LMICs, including an Asia-Pacific collaborative research network.</p>
<p><br>
	<strong>Session Outline:</strong><br>
  I.	Introduction and overview of methods for implementation research engaging children with disabilities and their families in LMIC. This covers methodologies for evaluating initial stage pilots through to transition to scale projects, and the continuum from researcher-lead to participatory methods.  (Badawi, chair). <br>
  II.	The learning objectives will be illustrated through practical examples from the field:<br>
  a.	Evaluation of “Saving Brains child development portfolio” in 23 LMICs (Milner).<br>
  b.	Adaptation and testing of caregiver support programs for children with disabilities (Afghanistan, Fiji, Milner). <br>
  c.	Supporting Ultra Poor People with Rehabilitation and Therapy-CP (Rural Bangladesh, Khandaker).<br>
  d.	Learning through Everyday Activities with Parents-CP Trial (India, Benfer, Branjerdporn) uses RCT, process evaluation, fidelity/ enactment and qualitative interviews. <br>
III.	There will be opportunity for questions and discussion with the presenter panel regarding participants’ own experiences (facilitated by Chair).</p>

	<p> <strong> Session description</strong><br>
  In a UNICEF project on Early Identification and Intervention, a multidisciplinary international team of experts has come together to develop a comprehensive programme for children with developmental delay and disabilities. The project especially targets low and middle income countries with the ultimate aim to develop recommendations for universal health programs to be used nationally. As a first step this program will be piloted in three countries (Uganda, Peru, Bulgaria), each with unique implementation challenges.<br>
  <br>
</p>
<p> The UNICEF Project includes two tiers identifying and addressing the needs of all children with developmental delays, and will in a third tier provide additional assessments and individually targeted interventions for children identified as being at high risk for four common disabling developmental disorders (see title). Each of the four Tier III intervention groups has systematically reviewed the scientific literature to identify current best practice; formulated an implementation strategy; selected, organized, adapted and/or developed materials that will be utilized for staff training and for coaching caregivers in the delivery of the intervention. The program will be based on the family goals for intervention and on the child’s current capabilities as well as desired target behaviors.</p>
<p>&nbsp; <br>
  <strong>Session outline</strong><br>
  Moderator and Presenters:<br>
  (5 minutes) Dr. Diane Damiano is a co-leader of the UNICEF project and the head of the intervention working group.  She will introduce all speakers and moderate the discussion.<br>
  (10 minutes): Dr. Hans Forssberg, also a co-leader along with Dr. Raoul Bermejo, who is the UNICEF Project Leader, will provide an overview of the entire project for all children with developmental delay (Tier I and II) and the rationale for additional services for these four key disabling conditions.<br>
  (15 minutes): Dr. Naomi Dale will present the early intervention pathway for children with visual impairments.<br>
  (15 minutes): Dr. Shelly Chadha will present the early intervention pathway for children with hearing impairments.<br>
  (15 minutes): Dr. Rachel Byrne will discuss the Tier III implementation strategy for children with high risk for CP<br>
  (15 minutes):  Dr. Lauren Franz will discuss the Tier III program for children identified as high risk for ASD<br>
  (15 minutes):  Questions from and Discussion with Attendees. Since this program is still in the process of development and evaluation, we hope to generate a lively discussion with this global audience who will hopefully share their experiences with or address questions to our presenters.<br>

	pdesc: `
	<p>General pediatricians, hospitalists, intensivists, complex care pediatricians, developmental and rehabilitation pediatricians, anesthesiologists, and orthopedic surgeons are all involved in the perioperative care of medically and neurodevelopmental complex patients. After three years of the careful and systematic evidence evaluation process, the International Committee on Perioperative Care for Children with Medical Complexity developed the education guide to help prepare children with medical/neurodevelopmental complexity for  musculoskeletal surgery. </p>
<p>There are four major content sections in this pre-op guide:</p>
<p>1. Overview: introduces the importance of pre-op preparation and provides an algorithm of key steps in that process.</p>
<p>2. Getting Started: focuses on monitoring for hip and spine problems that might require surgical intervention and provides conversation topics for families and providers to explore when first considering surgery.</p>
<p>3. Assessing Pre-Op Health: provides recommendations on how to systematically assess specific peri-op risk factors.</p>
<p>4. Acting on Health Assessment: provides guidance on how to address risk factors, make a final decision about whether to proceed with surgery and make final preparations for the safest transit through the peri-op episode of care.</p>
<p>The authors will discuss in detail each section's content and references, as well as leave plenty of time for Q&amp;A from the audience. The session will be highly interactive and its objective is to:</p>
<p>- Introduce this educational and practice informing tool to the audience<br>
  - Describe the evidence evaluation process yielding the content<br>
  - Analyze each section of the guide in detail using patient case scenarios<br>
  - Outline the checklist that could easily be implemented in a variety of patient environments that the audience would be able to share with their home institutions<br>
  - Recognize the potential for collaborative projects and research to improve the evidence<br>
</p>
<p>The target audience for the guide includes healthcare professionals from all backgrounds (e.g., general pediatrics, complex care, anesthesiology, surgery, hospital medicine, medical specialties) and training (e.g., nurses, physicians, case managers, social workers) who assist with perioperative care for children with medical complexity.  Patients and families also benefit from the information in the guide.<br>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> <br>
Eye-gaze control technology offers the potential for people with cerebral palsy and severe physical and communication difficulties to access technologies to enable play, education, leisure, social participation and communication. The presenters are part of an international research team which developed international clinical guidelines for eye-gaze control technology decision making. The guidelines build on the outcomes of a three-round online Delphi study, conducted to gain international stakeholder consensus on the content of clinical guidelines. In addition to the dissemination of knowledge, ideas from this workshop will contribute to knowledge translation. Effective knowledge translation strategies co-developed with people with cerebral palsy, their families, clinicians, funders and researchers, are required to support and evaluate uptake of the clinical guidelines.</p>

	<p><strong>Purpose: </strong><br>
To facilitate a discussion of how caregiver stress affects parents of children with developmental disabilities, how this stress can affect patient outcomes, and how providers may best assess for stress and provide evidence-based intervention to promote healthier relationships for caregiver couples and families.</p>
<p><strong>Course Summary:</strong><br>
There is a significant body of evidence that suggests that having a child with a developmental disability such as cerebral palsy can place considerable stress on parent couple relationships and families.  It is also very likely that caregiver stress and relationship difficulties can have a negative effect on patient outcomes.  This breakfast seminar will offer the opportunity for providers and caregivers to discuss what causes caregiver relationship stress, how to properly assess for stress and psychosocial risk, and how to execute brief, evidence-based interventions to help couples maintain healthy relationships. </p>
<p>Objective 1: To understand the body of evidence surrounding caregiver stress and its effect on couple relationships and families.<br>
  Objective 2: To understand from a first-person perspective how stress can affect a caregiver’s ability to cope and maintain healthy relationships. <br>
  Objective 3: To appreciate why mitigating caregiver stress and promoting parent relationship health is important for achieving best outcomes for children with developmental disabilities.<br>
Objective 4: To identify evidence-based tools for assessing caregiver stress and interventions to reduce psychosocial risk and promote relationship health.</p>
<p><strong>Target Audience:</strong> Special Needs Health Care Physicians, Nurses, Therapists, Social Workers, Mental Health Providers and Family Members</p>

Chair: Christelle Pons<br>
  Presenters: Bryce Johnson, Alain Chatelin, Jan Willem Gorter, Luca Randazzo, Johanne Mensah, Farida Bedwei<br>
  Technical and innovative solutions can prevent, compensate, relieve activity limitations or participation restrictions. They can be of precious help in the rehabilitation process and during daily living, to overcome difficulties of children and youth with disabilities and their families. However, many needs remain unmet, thus accelerating the innovation process is warranted.</p>
<p>This symposium, gathering families, engineers, health professionals presenters aims to:<br>
  - share the innovation process and bring awareness to the interest of being involved in technology development process for disabled persons as engineers/technicians, persons with disabilities and their families and health professionals<br>
  - demonstrate that innovation can be accelerated to more efficiently meet the needs of disabled persons through collaboration and co-construction between persons with disabilities and their families, engineers/ technicians, health professionals– in other words we are ‘better together’<br>
  - show examples of such collaborations for innovation <br>
- promote inclusive innovation for the development of technological solutions for children with disabilities. </p>
<p><strong>Session Outline</strong><br>
1/ How can needs lead to innovative products? (20minutes)<br>
  Bryce Johnson, Johanne Mensah<br>
  How to define a need? How to collect needs? How to address needs through innovation? How do rupture innovation can be inclusive, exploring new usages of new technologies? Experience from the health professional in collecting needs and levers identified by the developer in tech companies to bring innovation to disabled children/people.</p>
<p>2/ Authentic partnership are necessary (20minutes)<br>
  Jan Willem Gorter, Alain Chatelin<br>
Persons with disabilities and their families, engineers/ technicians and health professionals have to be able to communicate, work together and thus develop authentic partnerships to fill the gap between the problems and innovative solutions. Are we ready for coeducation , learning each other languages and balancing power differentials? A path forward working on representations and postures.</p>
<p>3/ Fruitful collaborations<br>
  Luca Randazzo, Farida Bedwei<br>
  Hackathons are one emerging interdisciplinary method to gather persons with different backgrounds and make them work to develop collaboratively. Coworking platforms are developed to link users, health professionals and engineers/firms/living labs. How to make them efficient to facilitate daily living of persons with disabilities and to promote community creation and engagement? Which specificities have to be taken into account depending on the cultural background in the different countries? </p>
<p>4/ Facilitated discussions (30 minutes): Dialogue between the presenters and the audience<br>
  What are the next steps for inclusive innovation? How to be efficient through coworking? How can we promote such initiatives and identify new levers? </p>

	<p><strong>Session Description</strong><br>
This symposium will be co-presented by young people and researchers. There is increasing recognition to involve young people as partners in health research. Recently, Van Schelven et al. (2020) published a scoping review on the involvement of young people with disabilities in health and social care projects. While the review focused on the value of “why” we engage with young people in research and “what” activities they have been involved in, there continues to be little information about strategies of “how” to engage with young people as research partners. The purpose of this symposium is to learn from experiences of international research partnerships, and its impacts on young people, research projects, and researchers. We take a non-categorical approach to consumer engagement recognizing the experiences of young people with various health conditions and their siblings.</p>
<p><strong>Learning Objectives </strong><br>
1. To learn about opportunities, challenges, facilitating and hindering factors to engage with young people in research in Canada, Netherlands, and United Kingdom. </p>
<p>2. To cultivate awareness of different models to guide engagement with young people in research. </p>
<p><strong>Session Outline </strong><br>
1. Opening (10 minutes) <br>
  The Chair (CM) will introduce the topic, presenters, symposium format, learning objectives, and interact with the audience about their backgrounds. </p>
<p>2. Background (10 minutes) <br>
BVO will provide an overview of current literature and ‘good practices’ about engagement with young people in research. </p>
<p>3. Five case examples will highlight roles of young people, experiences and outcomes in different phases of the Research Cycle. In this hybrid symposium, young people and researchers will co-present a dialogue of key elements that facilitated their partnership (40 minutes; 8 minutes for each case).</p>
<p>Better prioritization: How the experts by experience of the Youth Panel Care and Future Prospect influenced agenda setting (BVO, EVDM) </p>
<p>Better interventions through co-creation (JWG) </p>
<p>Better research and more impact: How collaboration between adolescents with cerebral palsy and researchers impacted the design and knowledge translation of a research project (MK) </p>
<p>Better partnerships with siblings in the design, execution, and knowledge translation of doctoral research (LN, HD, SB) </p>
<p>Better knowledge translation with young disabled research leaders: A rights-based methodology for research informed policy and practice (AF, JM) </p>
<p>4. Models (5 minutes) <br>
  CM will summarise models to illustrate various strategies to engage with young people in research. </p>
<p>5. Audience Discussion (moderated by CM, 25 minutes) <br>
  Questions will be provided to discuss opportunities, challenges, and strategies to engage with young people in research. </p>

	<p>1.	Describe the health inequities experienced by children with cerebral palsy (CP) and their families in Australia. <br>
  2.	Discuss how health care professionals can overcome common barriers and identify the unmet social needs of the families they meet.<br>
  3.	Summarise emerging evidence of interventions to systematically identify and address health inequities in the healthcare setting and discuss the potential application of these approaches in children with CP and their families. <br>
  4.	Discuss findings from EPIC-CP, a research project to co-design and pilot a social care navigation pathway with children with CP, their families and health service providers. </p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> <br>
Australian research has demonstrated a social gradient for adverse outcomes in children with CP. Disadvantaged children with CP are up to 50% more likely to be born with severe gross motor disability and are less likely to access the health services they need. Disadvantaged children with CP experience higher levels of morbidity and mortality, complete lower levels of education, are more likely to be unemployed and/or socially isolated. The social determinants of health (including poverty, poor housing, poor English proficiency, and social isolation) are barriers for families engaging with already complex and fragmented health and social care services.</p>
<p>Improving health outcomes for these children means addressing social as well as health needs. This is particularly pertinent given the likely long term adverse outcomes of the COVID-19 pandemic on persons with a lived experience of disability, including children/young people CP. </p>
<p>This workshop will share findings from EPIC-CP, a collaborative project between children with CP, their families, clinicians and researchers (Sydney Children’s Hospital Network, John Hunter Children’s Hospital and University of New South Wales). It will share insight from the co-design research project and help the audience understand barriers and enablers to identifying unmet social needs, how to sensitivity identify these needs during routine clinical care and potential care pathways for addressing unmet needs. </p>
<p>Interactive element: The workshop will include case examples for effective teaching. Participants will also engage in debate and consensus around barriers/enablers to identifying health inequities and ways to effectively identify needs within the clinical setting. </p>
<p>Target audience: Policy makers, researchers, consumers and clinicians working in the field of childhood disability, particularly with cerebral palsy and /or who have a lived experience of cerebral palsy.</p>

  Describe examples of good practice involvement at a project and organisational level<br>
  Outline a recently undertaken “Train the Trainer” initiative – a collaboration with Telethon Kids Institute and the Aus-CP-CTN Centre for Research Excellence<br>
  Provide a resource for attendees on where to seek further information and training on consumer and community involvement in cerebral palsy research</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> <br>
The quote “Nothing about us, without us” conceived in the 1990s by disability activists should be at the forefront of researcher’s and clinician’s minds when developing new projects. This breakfast session will present up to date evidence about the benefits of meaningful consumer involvement throughout all stages of research including: improving relevance and quality of research, increased public awareness of research and more effective translation of research. The presenters (both researchers and consumers) will outline examples of research projects where consumers have been involved at different stages of the research cycle, using different methods of involvement and will describe the benefits to the project, to the researchers and the consumers. </p>
<p>One organisation has developed a consumer group “CP Quest” which has now been running for five years, and has over 70 members. This group’s development and highlights will be shared, to help those who are wanting to commence a similar program at an organisational level. </p>
<p>Training to involve consumers helps increase the confidence of researchers and consumers. All presenters at this breakfast have recently taken part in a newly developed “Train the Trainer” course developed by Anne McKenzie and Belinda Frank at Telethon Kids Institute in collaboration with the Australasian Cerebral Palsy Clinical Trials Network, Centre of Research Excellence. This has been designed to build capacity and increase opportunities to receive training to include consumers in cerebral palsy research. This course will be briefly described and opportunities to participate in training will be shared, in addition to a curated list of links and resources to seek further information about consumer and community involvement. </p>
<p>The breakfast will be interactive throughout, and participants will also share their own experiences to learn from each other. By the conclusion of this workshop you will be inspired to start involving or increase involvement of consumers and community members in your future research. </p>
<p>Target Audience: All are encouraged to attend – families, clinicians and researchers </p>

	<p><strong>Participants will: </strong><br>
1. Discuss the nature and importance of child, family, and service provider engagement in pediatric rehabilitation therapy sessions<br>
  2. Explore how a suite of psychometrically sound measures of parent/caregiver, child, and service provider engagement can be used to enhance pediatric rehabilitation practice<br>
  3. Learn to use the tools for professional development of practitioners, education of students, and as process and outcome measures in research.</p>
<p>Engagement is important to client experiences in healthcare services and to their intervention outcomes. Engagement is often assumed and overlooked despite its important implications for the involvement of youth and parents in goal setting, in following through with agreed upon plans, and in relationships with service providers. Engagement is sometimes dismissed as a ‘soft skill’ when it should be viewed as a core skill to support and mobilize client change in healthcare practice. In our research program, we have defined engagement as active involvement and investment in therapy sessions. The lack of attention to engagement issues in pediatric rehabilitation therapy is partly due to not knowing how to recognize and measure engagement. This presentation provides information and a chance to explore the PRIME (Pediatric Rehabilitation Intervention Measures of Engagement) suite of tools. Participants will have the opportunity to learn about six tools that measure engagement from a variety of perspectives (youth, parent/caregiver, practitioner, and a non-involved observer). Most of the presentation will explore practice and educational applications, with focus on practitioner reflexivity and using the tools to improve practice. Interactive activities will include familiarization with the measures and strategies for practice change, with focus on language that will help pediatric rehabilitation providers talk about engagement. The course will also build capacity for attendees to use the PRIME measures as teaching tools for students training in the healthcare professions, as well as in research. </p>
<p>Interactive components, tailored for both in-person and online attendees, will begin with (1) a simulation-based activity. Attendees will view a recorded simulation of clinical practice followed by guided debriefing and discussion about engagement and factors influencing engagement. Subsequently, (2) a scoring activity will present case scenarios so attendees can practice completing the freely-available PRIME tools for clinical, education, or research purposes. To conclude (3) breakout groups will discuss interpreting results and identifying opportunities for change. </p>

	<strong>Session Description:</strong><br>
The COVID-19 Pandemic has influenced families, caregivers, health care providers and children with disabilities around the globe. As an international task force of over 50 health care providers from over 30 countries, we teamed together to create the IAACD COVID-19 Task Force. Three working subgroups were organized as follows: Listening and Sharing sessions, Resources and Surveys. As we met throughout the pandemic, our unified understanding of the impact and the means to cope and recover through this challenge provided pivotal examples of worldwide comparisons and contrasts. By understanding the impact, we can further understand the opportunities for improvement to promote the health and rights of children with disabilities and their support systems through and beyond COVID-19. This focused symposium will consist of a series of trans-disciplinary and international presentations. Attendees will engage in active discussions about that which each of the three subgroups within the Task Force developed and learned.<br><br>
<strong> Session Outline:</strong> <br>
1. Introduction of topics, speakers, format of the symposium and learning objectives. Session Chair, Arnab Seal, (5-10 min)<br>

	<p> Although classified as a disorder of movement, Cerebral Palsy has frequent overlap with other neurodevelopmental conditions, including seizures, autism and intellectual disability. Recent studies indicate that about 30% of people with Cerebral Palsy have a genetic contribution to their condition. Using genomic tools to understand cerebral palsy will provide direct benefits to clinicians, researchers, other professionals and carers of individuals affected by neurological disability.</p>
<p><br>
  In the emerging era of precision medicine, where therapies are increasingly tailored to an individual genomic variation, this development will eventually lead to personalized therapy. We imaging that this may be as the use of appropriate pharmaceutical or neutraceutical agents or by predicting that a syndrome may recur and counselling accordingly.</p>
<p><br>
  Derived from the genomics are model systems that allow an exploration of the mechanisms that underlay cerebral palsy. These tools also provide an understanding of the genetic and cellular networks that underpin cerebral plays and therefore provide novel avenues to therapies. </p>
<p><br>
  Epigenetics is the study of how the environment influences gene expression. In cerebral palsy, where conditional exposure may explain a difference in presentation, these tools extend our understanding of the condition. <br>
This symposium will collect national and international experts from a diverse range of countries, experience and gender (TBC). Our team will present on state of the art in CP genomics. Importantly, about the emerging data suggesting when and what testing should be undertaken in the clinical space. We will discuss how model systems including yeast, fly and zebrafish inform our understanding of CP. Also how they can be used to understand networks and pathways. We will discuss what we can learn from epigenetic studies. Finally, the team will discuss whether genetic information could assist with developing new treatments for CP. </p>

	<p><strong>Session Description </strong><br>
Little is known about the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander construct of disability. This understanding has significant implications for how First Nations communities engage with child development and disability services, including screening and intervention programs. With greater awareness of the importance of earlier screening and intervention based on the International Clinical Practice Guideline (Novak 2017), in addition to a growing number of disability services becoming available in communities under NDIS, it is pertinent to focus on the role of culture in such programs. <br>
  At completion of the symposium, participants will:<br>
  (i)	Have an understanding of the construct of disability for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. <br>
  (ii)	Identify screening tools with predictive validity and clinical utility for use with children at risk of neurodevelopmental disability.<br>
  (iii)	Have an awareness of approaches to providing support designed for or adapted for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. <br>
  (iv)	Understand the role of culture on screening (choice of measures, timing, explanation of purpose, communicating the diagnosis) and intervention (with consideration of parenting roles &amp; values, traditional practices &amp; explanatory models, health behaviour change, barriers &amp; facilitators).<br>
  (v)	Be familiar with the concepts of co-design with community lead solutions when developing culturally appropriate services.</p>
<p><strong>Session Outline </strong><br>
•	Overview of the prevalence and impact of neurodevelopmental disabilities in Aboriginal &amp; Torres Strait Islander communities. Exploration of cultural components influencing childhood disability programs including the construct of disability and child-rearing practices (Geia).<br>
  •	Reimagining Health Service Delivery: Co-design process, integrating best practice into community owned clinical care and community solutions. This will be illustrated through the experiences from the Yapatjarrathati project which partners with community to implement a culturally tailored tiered system for health screening (Shanley &amp; Page).<br>
  •	Which tools and what changes? Psychometrics and clinical utility of disability screening tools (Luke). <br>
  •	Enhancing care for children with Neurodevelopmental Disabilities: from improved care pathways to specific family-centred programs. This will explore how to develop existing health services to improve access and continuity of care as well as examples from specific programs (including LEAP-CP program adapted for Indigenous communities. It contrasts ‘evidence-based’ with ‘outcome’ informed programs (Hawkins &amp; Benfer).<br>
•	Cultural considerations to early screening and intervention: Understand the role of culture on screening (topics of shame/ blame, communicating the diagnosis) and intervention (parenting roles &amp; values, traditional practices &amp; explanatory models, health behaviour change, barriers &amp; facilitators) (Mick-Ramsamy).</p>

	<p> <strong> Session Description: </strong><br>
Indigenous populations have poorer access to culturally safe health service provision which impacts health outcomes. Underlying contributors to health inequities such as colonisation and racism are multifactorial and confronting.  Systemic, institutional and personal racism within health organisations continues today. Gaps in good health service provision are not the fault of First Nations’ people, but rather reflect a lack of accessibility to culturally safe health services and staff.  Acknowledging this in our own work is an essential part of developing culturally safe services.  This symposium will identify success stories and areas of continuing inequity for First Nations’ people with cerebral palsy (CP). Participants will be encouraged to discuss and reflect on reasons for and approaches to addressing potential inequity within their own work, and will leave with ideas to apply within their own context.<br>

<p><strong>Session Outline:</strong> <br>
  1.	Dr Danny De Lore (10 minutes): Defining health inequity for Indigenous people in the context of a shared colonial history of New Zealand, Australia and Canada<br>
  2.	Understanding the epidemiology of CP for Indigenous people, opportunities for prevention and strategies to improve health outcomes (45minutes).<br>
  -	New Zealand: Incorporating principles of Te whare tapa whā, Te Mana Raraunga and Kaupapa Māori to enable the CP register to collect quality data to support and facilitate research for identifying and addressing inequities within the NZ Health System. Findings from joint projects with Te Kupenga Hauora Māori, Respiratory Health in Tamariki with CP and Orthopaedic Surveillance will be presented. <br>
  -	Australia: Data from the CP register will be presented including prevalence, causes and outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children. Birthing on Country programs that are reducing preterm birth and supporting healthy pregnancies and families will highlight what can be achieved with culturally appropriate models of care. The changes required at the policy level to ensure people in rural areas have access to services will also be addressed. <br>
  -	Canada: Recent results from the CP registry found that Indigenous children had significantly more severe CP, with an increased frequency of feeding difficulties, communication and cognitive impairments. Geographic gaps in care distribution are apparent in areas with higher proportions of Indigenous people. Results suggest the need for culturally appropriate service delivery to improve care. <br>

<p>Session description<br>
This session will focus on different methodological approach to collect epidemiological data on cerebral palsy (CP) among children in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). </p>
<p>There are limited population-based data on the epidemiology of cerebral palsy (CP) in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). In absence of national registers, ensuring data quality is challenging specially in resource constraint settings of LMICs. The researchers often need to be innovative and adopt different methods utilizing the limited available resources/infrastructure. In this session the presenters will discuss the strength and limitations of commonly used methods such as key informant method (KIM), Health and Demographic Surveillance System (HDDS), institution-based surveillance/clinical cohorts in studying the epidemiology of CP in LMIC settings. The discussion will help researchers/academicians and professionals working with children with disability toward attaining reliable data and support epidemiology studies in LMICs. </p>
<p><strong>Session Outline</strong><br>
In this session three successful and replicable CP surveillance methods in LMICs would be highlighted; i. Community-based key informants’ method to collect data for the Bangladesh CP Register (BCPR), ii. Health and Demographic Surveillance System to conduct epidemiological studies on CP in Uganda, and iii. Paediatric Active Enhanced Disease Surveillance (PAEDS) mechanism to collect CP data in Hanoi, Vietnam. </p>

	<p>meaningful, goal-directed and task-specific (Beckers et al., 2020). The dosage is sufficient to enable learning and drive neuroplasticity (Jackman et al. 2020) and can be applied in an intensive or distributed model.<br>
  Despite these consistencies, there is growing recognition that significant differences exist in the guiding motor learning theories for each model and the strategies used to operationalize these theories. This is largely due to the fact that there is no “motor learning model” (Gentile, 1992).Multiple theories inform our understanding and interpretation of skill acquisition. These interpretations are also highly influenced by other discipline specific frames of reference. <br>
  The delivery of carefully considered and timely therapeutic actions remains very complex. Our observable therapeutic actions, including the selection and manipulation of tasks, practice, and feedback conditions can improve or interfere with learning and generalization of skills. We propose that constructive discussion is needed about the complexity of motor learning theory, rather than focus on dosage, to advance the field (Hoare, 2020). This will enable more accurate comparisons between therapy approaches and assist in maintaining treatment fidelity for the implementation of evidence-based approaches into clinical practice.<br>

	<p><strong>Session Description:</strong> <br>
Knowledge translation (KT) from research to clinical practice and implementation of evidence-based practice is often hindered by a number of barriers. The complexity of scientific language and the applicability of research that is generated largely in high income countries may be important barriers for the effective application of knowledge. Children with CP and their families often do not have access to the latest scientific evidence, or may have a limited understanding of what is applicable to their reality. In many low-and-middle incoming countries (LMIC), as those in Latin-American, there are added barriers to KT to include the actual language in which most scientific evidence is published (English), and the challenges in applying research produced in high income countries to the sociodemographic characteristics of the population, and the limited financial and professional training capacity of health and rehabilitation services and professionals. </p>
<p>This focused symposium will consist of a series of transdisciplinary presentations sharing some solutions for breaking barriers to KT, particularly in LMIC, using the example of one KT organization in Brazil. Attendees will be invited to contribute with challenges encountered in their context and to discuss solutions that can be replicated and foster international collaborations.</p>
<p><strong>Session Outline: </strong> </p>
<p>1. PR - Chair (10 minutes): PR will introduce the topics, speakers, and introduce examples of organisations developing powerful actions of  KT in collaboration with different institutions and active participation of individuals with disabilities.<br>

The F-Words for Child Development are built upon the World Health Organization’s International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) framework.  First published in 2012 (Rosenbaum &amp; Gorter), the F-words framework encourages us to concentrate on six words that should be the focus of thinking in the field of childhood disability: Function, Family, Fitness, Fun, Friends and Future. Initial efforts to raise awareness of the F-words included development of videos, posters and tools that can be used by families. These F-words materials are now available in more than 25 languages, illustrating the international appeal of these ideas. More recently, the CanChild F-words Team has partnered with clinician colleagues across the world to explore how the F-words can be implemented, and the impact that this conceptual approach has on families and service delivery. In this Symposium, we will use the Knowledge to Action Cycle to explore these implementation efforts in three diverse countries. Adaptations for the local context, practical strategies and lessons learned will be presented to support F-words implementation in a variety of practice settings.</p>
<p><strong>Session Outline </strong><br>
Chair: Peter Rosenbaum from CanChild (Canada) will introduce the presenters and the F-words for Child Development.<br>
  Presenter 1: Danijela Grahovac from CanChild (Canada) will outline how and why the F-words are important for children’s developmental services from her unique perspective as a member of the F-words Team and parent of a youth with cerebral palsy.<br>

Hip surveillance is the process of monitoring the critical indicators of hip displacement. Together with timely orthopaedic management, hip surveillance is effective in decreasing the incidence of hip dislocation in children with cerebral palsy. Clinical guidelines for surveillance have been developed around the world. While guidelines can provide recommendations for the frequency of surveillance, implementation into clinical practice is dependent upon the region or country’s healthcare system. Health services differ widely and no single model of implementation is appropriate across all jurisdictions. This session will explore implementation at local and population levels, in systems with and without universal healthcare, by comparing and contrasting implementation in 3 settings: Australia, Canada and India. </p>
<p>In Victoria, Australia, responsibility for hip surveillance is shared by the clinicians involved in a child’s care. While there are benefits associated with integrating surveillance into routine care, challenges arise when children access multiple health services. The pearls and pitfalls of this approach will be discussed, along with knowledge translation strategies implemented within a state-wide surveillance network.</p>
<p>In British Columbia, Canada, a province-wide, population-based surveillance program was implemented in 2016. The methods used to develop and implement this program will be reviewed. Considerations identified as being crucial to successful implementation, applicable at both population and local levels, will be shared. </p>
<p>The Paediatric Orthopaedic Society of India and the Indian Academy of Cerebral Palsy constituted a National Expert Committee in 2020, comprising representatives from national organizations providing care for children with CP. The methods used to review literature, create awareness about surveillance among stakeholders, and formulate contextually-relevant guidelines for India will be discussed, including progress toward dissemination of these guidelines in the public and private healthcare systems across India.</p>

	<p><strong>Session Description</strong><br>
Participation in valued life situations is key in promoting health and wellbeing in childhood-onset disability. Evidence for sound measures of participation and effective intervention strategies to improve participation exists, but practice is slow to change. A new international movement called LEAP (Leading Evidence to Advance Participation-focused practice) aims to address this pressing ‘knowledge-to-practice’ gap. LEAP comprises diverse researchers and stakeholders whose purpose is to seek meaningful collaborations to jointly- transform practice towards a focus on participation. For this purpose, effective Knowledge Translation (KT) implementation methods are developed and shared internationally. </p>
<p>This symposium will introduce a structured Participation-focused KT roadmap (P-KT) to guide all stakeholders interested in fostering a shift in practice. Specifically, a systematic and collaborative multi-level P-KT framework involving a ‘family-clinician-manager-community leader-policymaker’ synergy will be presented. The P-KT framework considers micro (client/family, service providers), meso (organizations such as rehabilitation centers, hospitals, schools, community agencies) and macro (local and governmental policy and regulatory bodies community, sociocultural context) ecological levels, and provides eight principles for enabling the uptake of participation-focused innovations. Common issues experienced when implementing participation-focused practice, paired with examples of solutions-based strategies to facilitate ‘readiness for change’ and ‘knowledge uptake’ will be discussed.  Identifying Who should be considered, What is needed and How to foster change are essential elements that will be presented. The approach will be illustrated through case examples from different contexts in both high and low resource settings such as Canada, The Netherlands, South Africa and India. The ultimate goal of the symposium is to LEAP together to bring about substantial change in practice behaviours, and consequently, in children’s outcomes. <br>

	ptype: "Focussed Symposium",

	pdesc: `
	A key aim of intervention is to optimise neuroplasticity in infants at risk    of Cerebral Palsy and children with Cerebral Palsy in response to effective    interventions.  Previous approaches to    classifying brain structure use qualitative approaches, which rely on expert    knowledge of the radiologist or neurologist to classify brain MRI structure    in broad predominant groups (WMI, GMI, Brain malformations), which are highly    correlated with presumed timing of the brain injury.  Other semi-quantitative approaches focus on    brain lesion severity (Fiori scale).  <br>
    <br>
    One of the key innovations in measuring the relationship between brain    structure and function in children with early brain injury is automated    analysis.  This enables clinicians and    researchers the opportunity to measure quantitative brain structure and the    relationship to motor, upper limb, cognitive and visual outcomes.  Recently there has been a move towards the    automated analysis of brain structure, allowing for prediction modelling of    long-term patient outcomes, and potentially incorporating genetic    information. Making these analyses available in the clinical setting can    revolutionize personalized medicine for children with cerebral palsy.<br>
    <br>
    This symposium brings together experiences from four countries (Australia,    Italy, Spain and USA) where researchers and clinicians have implemented brain    structure and function measures for children with CP. The objective of this    symposia is to describe (i) the various approaches to measuring brain    structure and function (psychological, motor, sensory) in infants at risk and    children with CP; (ii) examples of measuring brain structure and    reorganization; (iii) innovations in automated approaches available for    clinicians and researchers and (iv) challenges encountered and how these are    overcome.<br>

    <strong> SESSION DESCRIPTION:</strong><br>
Infants born preterm are at an increased risk of adverse neurodevelopmental    outcomes including cerebral palsy, autism spectrum disorder, and intellectual    disability; amongst others. The impact of these conditions can be ameliorated    by targeting interventions at a very young age, when neuroplasticity is    greatest. Gaining a deeper understanding of normal and abnormal early brain    development in the neonatal period is key to developing earlier predictors of    outcomes, enabling early intervention and allowing assessment of the brain’s    response.<br>
    The preterm neonate undergoes rapid brain development in the postnatal    period to term equivalent age. Neuroimaging, including MRI and EEG, provide    valuable insights into brain injury, as well as structural and functional    changes in this period. Clinical MRI identifies gross brain abnormalities    indicative of adverse outcomes, and semi-quantitative approaches can be used    to interrogate brain growth. Advanced MRI provides detailed insights into    brain development, including changes in morphology (cortical folding, volumes    of individual brain regions) and microstructure (myelination, organisation);    while advanced EEG elucidates brain connectivity. Measures obtained from    advanced MRI and EEG have shown to be associated with neurodevelopmental    outcomes and could augment clinical MRI interpretation; however, translation    into clinical practice remains challenging.<br>
    This symposium brings together experts from clinical and research    backgrounds from four countries (Australia, Italy, UK, USA) to present the    current state of early brain neuroimaging, and discuss barriers and    opportunities for translation into clinical practice.<br>

	<p> <strong> Session    Description :</strong> <br>
Laboratory-based optical motion capture is the current gold standard for    clinical motion analysis, but expensive and time consuming. It may fail to    capture how individuals move in natural settings. Markerless motion capture is    now feasible with availability of large-scale computing power and recent    developments in image-based analysis using deep learning approaches. Modern    computational methods, along with large publicly available datasets has    enabled the development of algorithms for human pose estimation from videos    and images, such as OpenPose and DeepLabCut. These provide the opportunity    for biomechanical analysis outside the laboratory. This session will provide    an international perspective on the use of markerless motion capture in    various paediatric settings, presented by a diverse team from four continents    (Asia, Australia, Europe and Africa) and with a variety of backgrounds.</p>

	<strong>Session    Description:</strong>  <br>
Cerebral palsy (CP) is    the most common childhood motor disability often resulting in debilitating    walking abnormalities, such as flexed-knee and stiff-knee gait. Currently    treatments are partially effective but may cause significant muscle weakness.    Emerging technologies and applications of neuromuscular electrical    stimulation (NMES) can potentially improve strength, tone, and mobility. NMES    can promote strength to improve upper and lower limb mobility. Pre- and    post-operative NMES can be used for strengthening to improve function for    children undergoing orthopaedic surgery. NMES can also be applied for tone    management of children with dyskinetic and spastic CP. Multichannel NMES    applied during cycling and treadmill training can promote mobility in    children with spastic CP. Wearable sensor-controlled multichannel NMES    devices are being developed to provide real-time biomechanical support and    sensory input during reach and gait. The objective of this symposium,    presented by international research teams, is to introduce the concepts,    technologies, and protocols for clinical application of multichannel NMES for    strengthening, tone management, reach, and gait for children with CP.    Development of wearable multichannel NMES can leverage lightweight wireless    stimulators and advanced control design to activate upper and lower limb    muscles non-invasively using surface electrodes. These technologies offer    promising interventions that can be implemented to improve mobility at home    and in the community for individuals living in high or low resource settings    worldwide. Evidence-based outcomes will be discussed to determine immediate    neuroprosthetic effects and longer-term neurotherapeutic effects of these    emerging applications for children with CP.<br>

	Objectives: Upon completion of this seminar participants will: 1) understand the neurophysiology behind select methods of priming cortical excitability across the lifespan in individuals with stroke; 2) be able to evaluate the evidence for select methods of priming across the lifespan in individuals with stroke; 3) be able to identify key measures of recovery and motor learning in infants, children and adults with stroke; and 4) be able to determine readiness for clinical implementation of neuromodulation and aerobic exercise as methods of priming in pediatric and adult rehabilitation.
	Summary: Neuromodulation strategies including transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), transcutaneous electrical stimulation (TES) and aerobic exercise have tremendous potential to prime the nervous system for motor learning after stroke at any age. This seminar will begin with a review of the evidence supporting how aerobic exercise can influence neuroplasticity to augment motor learning in typical adults and adults poststroke. Next pediatric research using tDCS concurrently with neurorehabilitation will be reviewed along with the efficacy for its usefulness to augment motor learning during young neuroplastic ages. Sensitive biomarkers currently recommended to use following neuromodulation will be reviewed. The state of the art for neuromodulation techniques including aerobic priming is quickly growing, yet, it is not clear if the evidence is sufficient to initiate integration into clinical practice. This interactive session will provide an opportunity for the audience to present their viewpoints on the interventions covered with the inclusion of other options such as TES. The discussion with the audience will focus on the feasibility and barriers to implementation of priming methods in infants, children and adults.
	Target Audience: Clinicians and researchers interested in the potential of neuromodulation techniques to augment recovery and motor learning at any age.

    <strong> Session Description</strong><br>
Increasing neuroplasticity to optimize response to interventions can    improve cost-effectiveness in neurorehabilitation. There is a growing    interest in inducing functional plastic changes in adults and children with    neurodisability using non-invasive neuromodulation techniques (such as    repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation, rTMS, and Transcranial    Electrical Stimulation, TES). Neuromodulation is used in conjunction with rehabilitation    strategies in order to prime or enhance endogenous neuroplasticity activated    by training in the desired learned behaviour in order to optimize    developmental trajectories. rTMS can be used to either upregulate neural    activity or downregulate neural activity in the stimulated region. This is    particularly useful when targeting regions (or nodes) of brain networks known    to be either underactive or overactive in particular disease states. For    example, rTMS is used to stimulate underactive left dorsolateral prefrontal    cortex in treatment-resistant depression; and downregulate excessive activity    in the supplementary motor area in Tourette’s disorder.<br>
    <br>
    <strong> Session Outline</strong><br>
This focused symposium will discuss the latest research into boosting    cognitive and sensorimotor rehabilitation in a variety of neurodisabilities    including cerebral palsy, traumatic brain injury, stroke and autistic    spectrum disorder. The important issue of efficacy and safety of using these    techniques in pediatric populations will be discussed.<br>
    •	Prof Enticott: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation to improve    social communication in autistic spectrum disorder. TMS has been used to    investigate the neurophysiology of ASD. Prof Enticott will discuss the use of    rTMS as a potential treatment to improve social communication in ASD in the    context of its neurobiology and his current multicentre RCT.<br>
    •	Prof Adam Kirton: Brain stimulation to optimize outcomes after perinatal    stroke. Brain injury at the start of life derails development with lifelong    consequences. Perinatal stroke accounts for most hemiparetic cerebral palsy    (CP). Noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) to potentially optimize    developmental trajectories toward better outcomes. Dr. Kirton will discuss    the use of rTMS and TES for the treatment of hemiparesis in childhood    stroke<br>
    •	Prof Karen Barlow: Non-invasive neuromodulation to improve    neurodevelopment following acquired brain injury. Neuropsychological outcomes    after acquired brain injury are poor yet only 17% of children receive    cognitive rehabilitation. Professor Barlow will discuss how rTMS and TES    offer potential to enhance traditional rehabilitation strategies and improve    outcomes.<br>

	<strong>Introduction:</strong> <br>
(RL 5min) Speaker introductions, symposium overview, and learning objectives    will be presented. This interdisciplinary group of physiotherapist,    bioengineer and biologist exemplify the theme of the conference which is    “BETTER TOGETHER.”<br>
    <br>
    Section 1: Molecular Scale: Epigenetic changes in skeletal muscle due to CP    (AD 20min)<br>
    DNA methylation is the most widely studied epigenetic imprint and has been    proposed as a new generation of disease-causing biomarkers with high diagnostic    and prognostic promise. Dr. Domenighetti will present novel biological    evidence that development of muscle impairment results from reversible    changes in DNA methylation that prevent muscle tissue from developing    normally during early postnatal life. He will also discuss the possibility    that comparison of DNA methylation profiles in blood and muscle tissues will    identify new diagnostic biomarkers in blood predicting outcomes of muscle    tissue development.<br>
    <br>
    Section 2: Cellular Scale: Changes to muscle connective tissue in CP (RL    20min)<br>
    While numerous studies have demonstrated that CP muscle is smaller and    stiffer compared to typically developing muscle, the underlying basis for    such differences is not known. Through extensive physiological, biomechanical    and biochemical studies of human muscle biopsies, Dr. Lieber and colleagues    have identified specific changes to the extracellular matrix (ECM) that occur    due to CP.  Specifically, alterations    to the collagen cable system that runs along muscle fibers and changes in    type 1 and type 3 collagen expression renders the muscle stiff and thus    resistant to therapy. These findings will be presented along with their    implication for treating children with CP.<br>
    <br>
    Section 3: Organ Scale: Changes to muscle and tendon function during gait    in CP (LB 20min)<br>
    The consequences of the altered muscle-tendon-unit (MTU) properties    described above on function, such as gait, are unknown. While fascicles    contain muscle contractile elements, it is the optimal interaction between    contractile and non-contractile elastic tissues (aponeurosis and tendon) that    determines function. Dr. Bar-On will show experimental data from medial    gastrocnemius muscle and tendon collected using in-vivo dynamic ultrasound    imaging during gait in children with CP and typically developing children.    She will demonstrate that pathological MTU dynamics in CP is evident even in    the presence of very mild gait deviations. <br>
    <br>
    Section 4: Audience Participation and Discussion (LB 20min)<br>
    Using the attendee&rsquo;s experience and the material presented, the audience    will participate in a discussion of the implications of micro- and    macroscopic muscular alterations for generating new treatments for children    with CP.<br>

	<strong>Chair</strong>    (10min)<br>
    Speaker Introductions, symposium overview, and learning objectives will be    defined. BoNT-A in children with CP will be explored using the ICF framework,    the topic of potential harm to muscle introduced, and the concept of working    &ldquo;BETTER TOGETHER&rdquo; instigated. <br>
    <br>
    Section 1: Botulinum Toxin A: a molecular marvel of protein design (KG    10min)<br>
    In the process of chemo-denervation BoNT-A acts as a molecular nanomachine,    acting precisely at cholinergic nerve terminals to block release of    acetylcholine by coordinated action on several key protein substrates. The    mechanism of action, which is similar in all mammalian species, from mice to    humans, will be reviewed and summarised, from both the motor nerve terminal    and skeletal muscle perspectives. <br>
    <br>
    Section 2: Botulinum Toxin is Bad for Skeletal Muscle (RL 15min)<br>
    The structural and functional changes that occur in animal models that have    been injected with BoNT-A will be presented.     The dosing, volume, timing and effect of repeated doses will be    discussed in the context of clinical use of BoNT-A.  Other models of muscle adaptation, such as    denervation, tenotomy and degeneration will be used for comparative    purposes.<br>
    <br>
    Section 3: The Pathophysiology of Contractures in Cerebral Palsy (RL    15min)<br>
    Muscle contractures represent a distinctively human phenomenon. Data will    be provided from intraoperative measurements of muscle structure that have    been taken during orthopaedic surgical procedures across several human    muscles.  In addition, the very unique    biological changes that occur in CP muscle will be described, which now    provide exciting possibilities for the use of other currently approved drugs    in future studies.<br>
    <br>
    Section 4: Proposition: &ldquo;Botulinum Toxin A is Good for Children with    Cerebral Palsy&rdquo; (KG 25min)<br>
    An extensive body of evidence supports the use of BoNT-A in children with    CP, including cohort studies, RCTs and systematic reviews. The evidence for    efficacy is stronger in the ICF domains of body structure and function, than    in the domains of activity and participation. New evidence from a    population-based study of spastic equinovarus in ambulant children with CP,    will be presented and discussed as a model for understanding the use of    BoNT-A in an ICF-based approach to clinical management of spasticity.<br>
    <br>
    Section 5: Audience Participation and Discussion (Chair 15min)<br>
    Using the attendee&rsquo;s experience, presented material, and evidence from a    new long-term, population-based study of spastic equinovarus, the audience    will discuss and participate in the active construction an evidenced-based,    management algorithm, which may be considered for use in children who live    with spasticity.<br>

	<strong>Background/Content:</strong> <br>
    Spastic hip displacement is the second most common musculoskeletal    deformity in children with cerebral palsy (CP), after equinus. Population    based studies have noted that hip displacement affects approximately    one-third of children with CP and is directly related to gross motor function    as measured by the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS). <br>
    Three principles guide the management of complex spastic hip subluxation.    (1) The pathophysiology is different than developmental hip dysplasia and    requires a different, comprehensive treatment protocol. (2) The natural    history of spastic hip subluxation is marked by increasing dysfunction, with    adverse effects on perineal hygiene, sitting intolerance, and pain in early    adulthood. (3) Salvage options for the skeletally mature patient with a    painful dislocated hip are limited. <br>
    The purpose of this instructional course will be to review a series of    challenging cases of spastic hip subluxation where the treatment of    reconstruction versus salvage will be discussed. In addition, we will review    treatment protocols for complex reconstruction and salvage procedures at two    institutions highlighting differences in practice pattern and health care    delivery. <br>
    <br>
    <strong> Learning Objectives:</strong><br>
1)	Recognize the pathophysiology associated with severe hip    subluxation<br>
    2)	Understand the relevant literature necessary to help guide surgical    decision making<br>
    3)	Apply a treatment algorithm for complex reconstructions and salvage    surgery in spastic hip subluxation from preoperative workup to postoperative    management<br>

	<strong>Objectives:</strong>  Participants will <br>
    1.	Describe the natural progression of musculoskeletal deformities in youth    with spastic CP   <br>
    2.	Identify indications and surgical methods to address hip subluxation in    youth with CP<br>
    3.	Engage in treatment planning for gait dysfunction alongside pediatric    orthopedic surgeons<br>
    4.	Adopt clinical practices to support positive musculoskeletal outcomes    for youth with CP<br>
    <br>
    <strong> Summary:</strong> Physical therapists and orthopedic surgeons are important    providers in the management of musculoskeletal conditions associated with    cerebral palsy (CP).  Although they    share objectives of optimizing motor function, preventing deformity, and    promoting participation, their care is too often provided in isolation rather    than jointly planned and mutually supported.     This instructional course informs pediatric physical therapists about    present-day surgical practices in multi-specialty centers of excellence for    cerebral palsy.  Evidence based    surgical approaches are described in terms of indications, principles, goals,    and expected outcomes for children and youth with CP with specific review of    hip surveillance, lever arm dysfunction, and single-event multilevel surgery    (SEMLS).<br>
Orthopedic surgery can be dramatic and life altering for children and youth    with CP when carried out by a specialized and knowledgeable team. Thoughtful    consideration of timing, indications, and biomechanical principles combined    with evidence-based protocols, intensive rehabilitation and long term    follow-up is necessary for success. When orthopedic surgery is performed    without the coordinated care of a specialty surgical, medical, and    rehabilitation team and the necessary infrastructure it can lead to loss of    function. <br>
    A review of current assessment tools and outcome measures utilized in    surgical care plans will include specialized imaging, instrumented gait    analysis, gross motor and physical exam measures, and patient-reported    outcomes.  The perioperative    management, potential surgical complications, and factors affecting long-term    surgical outcomes will be covered.  <br>
    Musculoskeletal care that is well coordinated between therapists, surgeons,    and families during the growing years of children with CP leads to thoughtful    decisions and well planned orthopedic surgical care. Such preparation reduces    family stress, builds trust, and positions the child and family for    successful and lasting surgical outcomes. <br>

    <strong> Session Description:</strong><br>
Chronic pain in individuals with CP significantly impacts participation and    well- being. Pain is under-recognized, undertreated and opportunities for    preventing pain can be missed. This course will guide the clinician in    understanding the pathophysiology behind the neuroplastic response to chronic    pain and how this can be used to guide management. The course will provide an    organizational framework for assessing and managing chronic pain in CP    including the identification of a pain outcome toolbox. Prevention of    care-related pain in CP as well as managing musculoskeletal pain will be    discussed in a case based format.  A    detailed overview of CBT approaches to chronic pain management in individuals    with CP will be provided. A stakeholder perspective on the impact of pain on    participation in individuals with CP will be presented.<br>

	ptype: "Seminar",

	pdesc: `
	<strong>Objectives:</strong> <br>
    (1) to understand the different behavioural phenotypes across 3    neurogenetic conditions representing a spectrum of impairment: Down syndrome,    Prader-Willi syndrome, Rett syndrome<br>
    (2) to describe physical activity and sedentary behaviours patterns    typically reported for young people with these conditions   <br>
    (3) to examine what models can inform activity and participation strategies    that can be usefully applied in practice   <br>
    (4) to review the available evidence for increasing exercise participation    and decreasing sedentary behaviour specifically involving young people with    these conditions.<br>
    <br>
    <strong> Summary:</strong> Physical activity provides opportunities for improved health and    social participation for young people with neurogenetic conditions. The 2020    WHO guideline on physical activity and sedentary behaviour for the first time    specifies the physical health benefits (e.g. improved physical function)    children and adolescents with intellectual disability can achieve from    participation in physical activity; and the risks of poorer health outcomes    (e.g. obesity, poorer cardiometabolic health, fitness, and behavioural    conduct; reduced sleep) from high amounts of sedentary behaviour. This major    advance has been facilitated by an acceleration in exercise-related research    in disability since 2010. However, much of this evidence concentrates on    physical disability in either young children with mild impairments or adults    with acquired or progressive disability. Comparatively, the literature for    children and young people with intellectual disability has grown to a much    smaller extent.<br>
<br>
    This session will focus on young people with three conditions–  Down syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome and    Rett syndrome–each associated with intellectual disability. It will be    presented in four parts: (1) an overview of each condition, including commonly    encountered difficulties with movement and evidence of usual physical    activity and sedentary behaviour patterns; (ii) a discussion of how    conceptual frameworks e.g. ICF and Family of Participation Related Constructs    can be used by clinicians and families to develop and/or inform practical    approaches to support young people (e.g. in terms of capacity building and    motivation) and to create supportive environments (e.g. by building in    opportunities for social interaction and enabling access to opportunities to    be active) that facilitate participation in opportunities for physical    activity; (iii) an analysis of available evidence on how to improve exercise    participation and reduce sedentary time in these groups; and (iv) a panel    discussion. <br>

	<strong>Session    Description:</strong><br>
    Allied health professionals are increasingly aware of the need to implement    participation-focused interventions for children with cerebral palsy and    other neurodevelopmental disabilities. In the last 5 years there has been significant    research investment into testing the efficacy of participation-focused    interventions, including a number of clinical trials. Examples of named    interventions include ParticiPAte CP, Pathways and Resources for Engagement    and Participation (PREP), Physical Activity on Prescription (PAP), and the    Jooay© mobile app. Despite similar goals, these interventions are both    practically and theoretically eclectic. This may lead to confusion among    therapists, youth and their families about which approach/es may suit their    context, needs and preferences.<br>
    <br>
    This focused symposium will consist of a series of trans-disciplinary    talks. Each presenter will provide their unique perspective on    participation-focused therapy with the most up-to-date evidence from    world-leading research programs. Lively discussion will address some hot    topics in the field, including: promoting leisure participation in the    COVID-19 era, how impairments and activity limitations are addressed by    participation-focused therapies, environment and context-level interventions,    and the science of health behaviour change. Attendees will leave with a raft    of potential evidence-based solutions to the challenges of implementing    participation-focused therapy, and ideas to apply in their unique    context.<br>

	<strong>Session    Description:</strong> <br>
    Guided by the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and    Health (ICF), participation is currently considered the main outcome of    pediatric rehabilitation. Despite this, many countries still face challenges    in implementing participation-focused practices for children with    disabilities. The main reason is that many validated participation    measurement tools were originally developed in English speaking countries,    such as Canada, United States and Australia. In order to address this issue,    the use of a rigorous methodological process is critical, encompassing  translation, cross-cultural adaptation and    validation stages. In this symposium, researchers from Spain, Portugal, Brazil    and Colombia will discuss the methodological similarities and differences for    obtaining valid and reliable instruments for participation assessment in    their countries. In addition, the participation patterns of children with    disabilities evaluated using the Participation and Environment Measure –    Children and Youth (PEM-CY), Young Children&rsquo;s Participation and Environment    Measure (YC-PEM), Children's Assessment of Participation and Enjoyment (CAPE)    and Preferences for Activities of Children (PAC) measures will be presented,    enabling  a rich discussion on barriers    and facilitators in different countries, paths for context-focused    interventions and possibilities for a collaborative network in future    research.<br>

	ptype: "Seminar",

	pdesc: `
	<strong>Objectives: </strong><br>
    1.	Participants will be able to describe the current literature on sexual    health in individuals with cerebral palsy (CP).<br>
    2.	Participants will list societal, personal and physical barriers to    sexual participation  that are unique    to people with CP and developmental disabilities.<br>
    3.	Participants will develop strategies for addressing sexual concerns for    their patients with CP.<br>
    <br>
    <strong> Summary: </strong><br>
Holistic care for people with cerebral palsy involves addressing a large    set of domains, often with the goal of maximizing the individual’s    performance within the framework of the ICF. One component of activity and    participation that often falls through the cracks is that of sexuality,    despite its often critical contribution to an individual’s identity.&nbsp; The term, “sexuality” serves as an umbrella    term for sexual feelings, identity, engagement, and behaviour, among other    subdomains. Talking about sex can be difficult to initiate and is easily    avoided in the busyness of a clinic visit, but the literature indicates that    patients are eager for this conversation with providers. <br>
    <br>
    Knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs about sexuality in individuals with CP as    well as the integration of sexual history into routine practice will be    explored. Current literature about prevalence of sexual concerns and needs    among adolescents and young adults with CP will be reviewed.  Multiple modalities will be used to promote    audience discussion, including polling and video footage.  Best practices will be defined and useful    provider and patient resources identified. Focus will be on identifying    simple transformative practices to move the topic of sex into a routine    domain of provider-patient engagement through group discussion and    distillation of the literature. Cultural variation and sensitivity will be    acknowledged.<br>
    <br>
    <strong> Target Audience:</strong> Anybody with interest in CP, including care providers and    people with cerebral palsy.<br>

	<strong>Objectives</strong> <br>
    To optimise motor rehabilitation for children with motor disorders, we need    to understand the motor and cognitive processes involved in skill    development. This workshop will take the audience on a journey from research    on motor planning to science-led practices for children with a    neurodisability.  <br>
    <br>
    More specifically, participants will be given:<br>
    1.	state of the art on motor imagery (MI), action observation (AO) and    motor planning research on children with cerebral palsy (CP) and DCD, and its    implications for rehabilitation;<br>
    2.	recent advances in the use of AO-MI training for rehabilitation    practice;<br>
    3.	an update on the use of constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT),    bimanual therapy (HABIT), and cognitive approaches. <br>
    4.	the opportunity to consider how these current practices may be    incorporated into their own research and/or practice. <br>
    <br>
    <strong> Summary</strong> <br>
In this instructional course, we will first provide a theoretical model of    key concepts in motor control and learning, highlighting the relationship    between motor planning, action observation (AO), and motor imagery (MI).  Second, we will provide an overview of the    recent empirical studies on MI and AO in cerebral palsy and DCD, including    studies involving EEG. Third, we will discuss the use of MI and AO training    for upper limb rehabilitation. Fourth, we describe the rationale for    constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) and bimanual training (HABIT) for    children with CP, and recent data on their efficacy. Finally, examples will    be discussed on how these various innovations – MI training, AO and CIMT –    may be integrated within existing treatment programs.<br>  
    <br>
    <strong> Interactive Element</strong><br>
The workshop will consist of a series of mini presentations on (i) current    models of motor control and learning; (ii) the relationship between motor    planning, MI and AO; (iii) evidence for deficits in motor planning and MI in    CP-DCD; (iv) current intervention work on the use of AO-MI in neuromotor    disorders; (v) evidence for efficacy in the use of CIMT and HABIT for CP, and    (vi) methods to integrate these various techniques into everyday    practice.   As well, we will conduct    both small interactive groupwork and larger group discussion where attendees    can explore how these methods can be incorporated into their existing service    frameworks and/or research. <br>
    <br>
    <strong> Target audience</strong><br>
Scientists, physiotherapists, medical doctors, occupational therapists<br>
    <br>
    <strong> Level</strong><br>
The workshop is designed to address issues of relevance to practitioners    and researchers at any level of expertise. <br>

	<strong>Session    Description</strong><br>
    <br>
    Over the past two decades, the need for disability healthcare to evolve    from an impairment model to focus on participation has been well-documented.    This is exemplified by adoption of the F-words framework into child-onset    disability healthcare programs. However, as services move from impairment    focus towards participation, will traditional evidence-based therapy become    redundant?<br>
    <br>
    <strong> Session Outline</strong><br>
    <br>
    This future vision will be debated in traditional form with a Chair and 4    speakers. <br>
    <br>
    <strong> Knight (Chair):</strong> Introduce the topic and set the scene for the focus on    participation in child-onset disability. The Chair will introduce speakers    and moderate debate. <br>
    <br>
    <strong> Imms:</strong> Will advance the case that participation-focused approaches to living    a good life require social approaches to addressing barriers and building    supports needed for those with disability. There is no need to consider    ‘therapy’. Therapy should be delivered in clinical settings and confined to    problems at the level of body. Healthcare professionals have stepped into    areas that are none of their business. It will be argued that healthcare    professionals don’t actually know what they are doing when they approach the issue    of community participation, a finding well supported by disability sport,    recreation and leisure literature. <br>
    <br>
    <strong> Toovey:</strong> Addressing the topic from the perspective of “No therapist – No    medal”, Toovey will refute the case of Imms, arguing evidence for specialised    therapeutic and healthcare knowledge to adequately address the complex and    specialised needs of those with disability to ensure participation. Evidence    supporting the call for specialist therapeutic support for participation will    be presented, highlighting the vital contribution of healthcare professionals    to participation outcomes. <br>
    <br>
    <strong> Scheinberg:</strong> Will rebut Toovey’s position, and further advance the argument    against needing healthcare professionals to support participation – robots    will be all that are required. Advances in everyday technology that any    ordinary person can operate will solve all access issues.    Technician-programmed robots will resolve accommodations required to support    individuals in negotiation of environmental factors needed to participate in    chosen life situations. <br>
    <br>
    <strong> Kleinitz:</strong> Addressing the issue from settings in which there are no    therapists, few healthcare professionals and certainly no robots, Kleinitz    will call for highly specialised evidence-based education to ensure the newly    minted population of healthcare professionals in low and middle income    countries graduate knowing how to be participation-focused; embedding    discipline-specific knowledge within a participation-focused framework. <br>
    <br>
    <strong> All speakers:</strong> 2-minute rebuttals of any other proposition put forward. <br>
    <br>
    <strong> Audience:</strong> <br>
1.	Vote on the debate winner<br>
    2.	Engage in Q &amp; A on the topic<br>

	ptype: "Focussed Symposium",

	pdesc: `
	<strong>Session    Description:</strong><br>
    The symposium will provide an overview of current best practice in the    identification of Cerebral Visual Impairment (CVI) and in devising    intervention in infants and children with cerebral palsy. Underlying    mechanisms of CVI will be explored by elucidating brain-behaviour correlates    in the light of the specific mechanisms of plasticity in the visual brain.    Strengths and limitation of current tools to assess visual functions and    functional vision in infants and children will be described, within the    framework of ICF and the recently developed Visual Function Classification    System (VFCS). Best evidence of early intervention in infants at risk of CP    with CVI will be covered, including the importance of addressing visual    difficulties in the context of structured rehabilitation programs based on    environmental enrichment and motor learning.<br>
    <br>
	At completion of the symposium, participants will:<br>
    (i)	Increase awareness of the visual difficulties experienced by infants    and children with CP;<br>
    (ii)	Understand the relationship between brain structure, visual function    and reorganisation;<br>
    (iii)	Develop uniformity in definition and evaluation of CVI, by having    knowledge of the best tools used for the assessment of visual functions in    infants and children with CP;<br>
    (iv)	Have an understanding of the principles of vision-aware intervention    in infants and children with CP, including the knowledge of their limitations    and expected outcomes;<br>
    <br>
    <strong> Session Outline:</strong><br>
(i)	Definition of CVI and understanding of neural correlates and    reorganization (Salt, Guzzetta)<br>
    (ii)	Assessment of vision in infants and children with cerebral palsy    (Philip)<br>
    (iii)	Principles of vision-aware intervention in infants and children with    CP (Salt, Guzzetta)<br>
    (iv)	Panel discussion and Q and A.<br>

	<strong>Objectives:</strong><br>
    1.	Learn different approaches on development of interventions for children    with Cerebral Visual Impairment <br>
    2.	Understand the interdisciplinary design and development process of    serious games from start to implementation<br>
    3.	Provide insight into the lessons learnt from the development    phases<br>
    4.	Learn how to get children engaged in game-based interventions<br>
    5.	and how to implement training programs in society <br>
    <br>
    <strong> Summary:</strong><br>
This seminar will present some of the current  individualized and adaptive computerized    interventions for cerebral visual impairment (CVI). We will  shortly introduce the characteristics of    CVI showing its heterogeneity and need for targeted intervention. 1) We will    describe the main aspects addressed in the development of the CatchMe! game    that targets visuomotor coordination and the HelpMe! game that targets the    ability to see and touch an object while at the same time being involved in    semantic decision making and basic problem-solving (Italy). The relevance of    addressing cognitive and linguistic constraints will be shown as well as the    contribution of an eye-tracker system in identifying indices of children’s    learning and improvements to introduce in re-habilitation programs. 2) Four    mini-games (MatchMaker, Hurricane Chaos, Maze Explorer 2D, Maze Explorer 3D)    developed within the context of the iVision project (Belgium) will be    demonstrated. We will describe the visuoperceptual profile (calculated from    clinical tests) and how it serves as a basis for matching between a child’s    individualized needs (strengths and weaknesses) to their specific training    scheme. 3) The Eyelander game (UK) designed to improve visual search ability    will be  introduced with discussion    focussing on participatory design, engaging children in therapy, design and    development from initiation to closure, and lessons learnt. All  presented games were developed using a    multidisciplinary approach involving clinicians, parents, technology    developers, combined with iterative testing with the users themselves. Such    serious games can potentially be implemented in non-clinical and educational    settings in which these activities can be proposed for rehabilitation    purposes and skill development. We will end by summarizing the main key    points helpful to keep in mind when developing serious game rehabilitation    programs for CVI.<br>
