        <p>Welcome to the Congress! There are currently over 40 CP registers and surveillance systems working throughout the world. The last five to ten years has seen a rapid increase of registers in low/middle income countries, providing population data from these countries for the first time. Join us for presentations from speakers around the world, and discussions on the following topics:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Global trends and current rates of CP An opportunity to discuss findings being presented for the first time</li>
          <li>A focus on post neonatal CP classification, sources of ascertainment and prevention opportunities</li>
          <li>Which regions of the world now have registers/surveillance systems and for what purposes? Connect with colleagues and friends (old and new)</li>
          <li>Established and emerging registers in low/middle income countries Successes, alternate methods, practical strategies and sustainability</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The congress is an opportunity for those working on and with registers, and others interested in their work, to come together, share findings, brainstorm solutions to problems and instigate collaborative initiatives.</p>

        <p>Health and wellbeing benefits of physical activity (PA) are particularly important for people with disability. Physical activity must begin with a person choosing to participate (i.e. attend and be involved) but decisions regarding choice of exercise and navigating what is available based on ability and age may be challenging. This symposium will discuss reasons to promote participation PA at each level of exercise intensity across the severity spectrum, 24-hour activity guidelines, and relate evidence of successful exercise prescription recommendations into practical examples. We will highlight the importance of sustained participation in PA for long term health and wellbeing of people with a disability and consider how to successfully achieve this. An emphasis will be placed on the young person’s experience of participation (involvement) as told through personal stories and feelings. New evidence examining the shift in focus to sedentary and light activity, and healthy sleep behaviours applied across different functional abilities and the lifespan will be addressed.</p>

        </div>
        <p>During this Workshop we will first provide background information about different management options for spasticity treatment, followed by more specific information about the history of selective dorsal rhizotomy (SDR) and the different surgical techniques. Thereafter presenters from Africa, North America, Europe, Asia and Oceania will give insight about their practices (e.g. surgical techniques, selection criteria, post-operative management) and outcomes, leading to an opportunity to ask questions and discuss the different practices and outcomes between the institutes.This will followed by a session about post-operative management and policies & services around SDR. Lasty there will be a presentation about new SDR techniques and alternatives to SDR as well as other diagnostic groups. Lastly, there will be another opportunity for questions and answers.</p>

          <p>The aim of this Workshop is to introduce and discuss the latest advances in the field of Genomics of Cerebral Palsies (CP) and with the members and supporters of the International Cerebral Palsy Genomics Consortium. The agenda of the workshop aims to inform the participants about the most up to date CP gene diagnostic gene panel and what constitutes a CP gene. To discuss engagement with the CP communities and specifically in view of the impact of a genetic diagnosis and treatment opportunities such a diagnosis may present. We shall also present select state-of-the-art basic and translational research in genomics of CP or related fields.</p>

        <p>Improving the physical and mental health is an imperative for adults with cerebral palsy (CP). Evidence is emerging of poor health resulting in reduced quality of life and shortened lifespan. Whilst comprehensive services are available for children through paediatric networks, there is a clinical and research void after transition and into and throughout adulthood. Our vision is a world where people with CP receive the best care throughout their lives and are thus enabled to participate more fully in society.</p>
        <p>This workshop by an international panel from the United States, Canada, Sweden and Australia will focus on new and challenging issues in adults with CP and how they might be addressed. Current knowledge about the physical and mental health status of adults will be presented, including healthcare services research in Europe, health status and unmet rehabilitation needs in Sweden, and participation-focused interventions to increase physical activity across Australia.</p>

        <p>This symposium will focus on the structural, functional, and adaptive skeletal muscle changes occurring in people who with live with cerebral palsy. Multidisciplinary speakers will address a range of topics from basic science research to clinical management. Eight different sessions will explore muscle tissue structure, muscle metabolism, neurophysiology and motor control, exercise and rehabilitation, Botulinum toxin, musculoskeletal health, and future directions. Integrative discussions and clinical case presentations will be used as a basis for audience participation regarding optimal muscle health and future directions.</p>

        <p><b>Part 1:</b> International Guidelines on early detection of cerebral palsy have been available for the past 5 years and have seen changes in practice globally. In this workshop, global experiences of translation in different contexts will be explained and discussed in terms of outcomes and challenges. Updates on automated GMA scoring, new data about the HINE and educational opportunities for clinicians will be provided. A live panel will conclude the session.</p>
        <p><b>Part 2:</b> This workshop will outline the current state of the science in 2022 on early intervention for cerebral palsy. This pre-conference symposium will include a multidisciplinary global panel of experts and present the key ingredients and results of novel early intervention clinical trials either completed or ongoing in infants with or at high risk of cerebral palsy. The session will include discussion on implementation strategies, and future research opportunities.</p>

        <p>Cell-based therapies have neuroprotective and neuroregenerative potential for perinatal brain injury. This symposium brings together international experts to provide a status update on clinical trials for cell therapies, and how neuroprotective efficacy might be enhanced. We will also examine what is on the horizon for novel therapies particularly aimed at the preterm brain.</p>
