 <h2 class="mb-0">Prof. Suzanne Miller</h2>
 <h3 class="mt-0">Australia</h3>

 <p>Professor Suzie Miller’s training and expertise is in neurodevelopmental physiology. Suzie is an NHMRC Senior Research Fellow (Level B), Deputy Director of The Ritchie Centre at Monash University and the Hudson Institute of Medical Research, and she leads the Neurodevelopment Theme at the Centre. Her research group predominately uses experimental animal models of the primary causes of neonatal brain injury – including intrauterine infection, preterm birth, fetal growth restriction, and perinatal asphyxia - to better understand the progression of neuropathology under compromised conditions, so that targeted interventions can be implemented. Suzie and her clinical and research colleagues are working towards the translation of neuroprotective therapies before or after birth, so that neonatal brain injury can be reduced, and cerebral palsy might be prevented. An example of the translation of positive preclinical results through to clinical trial is evident in the current PROTECT-ME trial of antenatal melatonin for pregnancies complicated by fetal growth restriction; Suzie led the preclinical work to show that melatonin acts as a strong neuroprotective agent for the developing fetal brain, predominantly via melatonin’s anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. This international trial is currently recruiting and we keenly await results.  </p>

             <h3 class="mt-0">What can delegates expect to hear from you?</h3>
             I intend to cover some historical aspects of development of Paediatric Rehabilitation services in Australasia, the importance of teams working together and present some thoughts about future development.

            <h3>Highlight the international relevance of your work for delegates?</h3>
            <p><em>It is hoped that the experiences in the development of Paediatric services in Australasia will be of some use to other areas of the world where these services are yet to be in place.</em></p>

            <h3>What key messages will you have for community members and people with lived experience of child-onset disability?</h3>
            <p><em>The message is that there is a group of well-trained trained professionals; therapists, nurses and doctors who are dedicated to sharing their knowledge in assisting you in the care for your child. You are not alone.</em></p>

            <h3>What makes conferences such as this important?</h3>
            <p><em>One of the ‘lessons” from the restrictions that Covid has taught is the importance of the collegiate experience of meeting with colleagues, sharing viewpoints and mixing socially. It is to be hoped that our meeting in 2022 will allow this to be re-introduced so we can all benefit from the interchange of information from the widespread group of attendees that the combined meeting will bring together.</em></p>

            <h3>What is the best piece of advice you could give a student or early career researcher who is attending their first big conference?</h3>
            <p><em>The clearest thing I remember from attending my first American Academy of CP meeting was not the information learned. It was unquestionably the people I met and with whom I have caught up with many times at subsequent meetings and in several cases have visited them and vice versa. Make yourself known. We’re a friendly lot.</em></p>

            <h3>What are you most looking forward to at the Better Together 2022 Conference?</h3>
            <p><em>The same as the above answer.</em></p>

            <h3>Do you see any particular benefits of having the conference in Melbourne/ Australia?</h3>
            <p><em>For the “second best” city in Australia it is still a wonderful place to visit! The food scene is fantastic – maybe even better than my home city of Sydney - and transport access is excellent with March being a great time to visit and enjoy the local hospitality.</em></p>

            <h3>Do you have any hobbies outside of your work?</h3>
            <p><em>I play golf – a lot; travel – a lot when Covid allows; socialise with friends and enjoy dining out and good wine.</em></p>

            <h3>What was your guilty COVID isolation pleasure?</h3>
            <p><em>Undisturbed reading – I did not feel too guilty though.</em></p>

We should not ignore the importance of expectations, assumptions, and values.</em></p>

              <h3>What makes conferences such as this important?</h3>
              <p><em>The key value to me is the coming together of like-minded people with similar interests. Conferences such as this serve to develop a ‘community of practice’ that embraces researchers, people with lived experience, clinicians, students, and educators.</em></p>

             <h3 class="mt-0">What can delegates expect to hear from you?</h3>
             <p><em>A bit of review about “what we know” about muscle in cerebral palsy but also current and future opportunities for discovery and treatment in children with cerebral palsy.</em></p>

             <h3>Highlight the international relevance of your work for delegates?</h3>
             <p><em>I believe that our work is relevant to the world in that we are one of the few laboratories in the world working on actual skeletal muscle from children with cerebral palsy rather than working on animal models.  The work is slower, because it requires human subjects research, but we believe that it is extremely relevant and offers the promise for development of future therapeutics.</em></p>

             <h3>What key messages will you have for community members and people with lived experience of child-onset disability?</h3>
             <p><em>There is great hope for the future to help kids with cerebral palsy.  We have new sets of powerful tools, are more closely aligned in purpose, and have better communication than ever.  We are here to help!</em></p>

             <h3>What makes conferences such as this important?</h3>
             <p><em>It is rare for investigators with such diverse backgrounds to gather around a single purpose—helping our patients with cerebral palsy and working toward their improved lives.  Typically, we gather with folks of the same discipline, not those trying to solve the same problem!</em></p>

             <h3>What is the best piece of advice you could give a student or early career researcher who is attending their first big conference?</h3>
             <p><em>Follow your passion and intentionally link your cart to great mentors.</em></p>

             <h3>What are you most looking forward to at the Better Together 2022 Conference?</h3>
             <p><em>I love spending time with my international colleagues and to vibrant and open discussions related to important topics in cerebral palsy patients.</em></p>

             <h3>Do you see any particular benefits of having the conference in Melbourne/ Australia?</h3>
             <p><em>We have to intentionally get away since it’ such a long trip for everyone.  As a result we probably will not have folks coming in just for a day.  Thus, we can have long and sustained interactions that should lead to new collaborations and experiments.</em></p>

             <h3>Do you have any hobbies outside of your work?</h3>
             <p><em>I am an avid runner and love playing guitar alone or with friends.  I am also an avid sports fan!</em></p>

             <h3>What was your guilty COVID isolation pleasure?</h3>
             <p><em>I am boring. I read some great books!</em></p>

             <p><em>A new way of thinking about behaviour and how to change it, both in relation to professionals and in relation to those they are providing a service to. Relevant resources are on the <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/behaviour-change/" target="_blank">Centre for Behaviour Change website</a>.</em></p>

             <h3>Highlight the international relevance of your work for delegates?</h3>
             <p><em>The Behaviour Change Wheel guide to developing interventions is my most widely read book. A user-friendly version is available <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/behaviour-change/resources/achieving-behaviour-change-guides-government" target="_blank">free</a>.</em></p>

             <h3>What key messages will you have for community members and people with lived experience of child-onset disability?</h3>
             <p><em>Understanding behaviour and how to change it is of potential use for everyone – in relation to enabling others and thinking about one’s own situation.</em></p>

             <h3>What makes conferences such as this important?</h3>
             <p><em>After the global pandemic, conferences where people can be together in person, sharing the same experiences, networking over drinks and meals and discussing issues in the same room will be a great treat.</em></p>

             <h3>What is the best piece of advice you could give a student or early career researcher who is attending their first big conference?</h3>
             <p><em>Don’t be afraid to go up to speakers or anyone else and talk to them – conferences are about networking and my favourite conferences are those where first year students and Professors talk (and even dance) with each other.</em></p>

             <h3>What are you most looking forward to at the Better Together 2022 Conference?</h3>
             <p><em>Getting to know something of a scientific and professional organisation that is new to me and meeting new people doing important work.</em></p>

             <h3>Do you see any particular benefits of having the conference in Melbourne/ Australia?</h3>
             <p><em>I have been to many cities in Australia and Melbourne remains my favourite – coming from London, diversity and celebrating diversity in all forms including culturally, are important.</em></p>

             <h3>Do you have any hobbies outside of your work?</h3>
             <p><em>Tennis, yoga, walking, cryptic crosswords, playing with my grandchildren</em></p>

             <h3>What was your guilty COVID isolation pleasure?</h3>
             <p><em>I don’t do guilt, such an unhelpful emotion! Putting my camera off and do what I want to do during boring meetings was fun.</em></p>

             <h3 class="mt-0">What can delegates expect to hear from you?</h3>
             <p><em>My talk will present our most recent preclinical data to show the correlation between the progression of neuropathology that occurs with fetal growth restriction (FGR) and functional deficits in the neonatal period, with a particular emphasis on compromised brain connectivity in infants born with fetal growth restriction.</em></p>

             <h3>Highlight the international relevance of your work for delegates?</h3>
             <p><em>My group have been characterising neuropathology associated with fetal growth restriction for over a decade, and the work I will present at the meeting complements the work of international groups such as that of Professor Petra Huppi (who is also presenting at the meeting) who have shown deficits in brain connectivity using brain imaging. Our work has examined the progression of neuropathology at the individual cellular level, which likely underlies poor brain connectivity.</em></p>

             <h3>What key messages will you have for community members and people with lived experience of child-onset disability?</h3>
             <p><em>I am really keen to let community members know that my team, and many scientific research teams around the world, are working extremely hard to better understand the mechanisms that cause perinatal brain injury so that interventions and therapies can be in implemented to reduce the progression of brain injury, with the end-goal of preventing disability.</em></p>

             <h3>What makes conferences such as this important?</h3>
             <p><em>The AusCPDM/ IAACD meeting is a fabulous opportunity to bring together varied expertise, experience and up-to-date results to improve outcomes for individuals with cerebral palsy and childhood disabilities. There is no other conference like it where we can hear from such a large number of speakers all working towards this common goal of improved outcomes.</em></p>

             <h3>What is the best piece of advice you could give a student or early career researcher who is attending their first big conference?</h3>
             <p><em>I would really encourage students and ECRs to engage and speak with presenters and other meeting attendees. Large meetings can feel a bit intimidating, but it is such a great opportunity to talk to others, make new friends, ask questions and tell others about your own work.</em></p>

             <h3>What are you most looking forward to at the Better Together 2022 Conference?</h3>
             <p><em>I’m looking forward to carefully highlighting and mapping my timetable so I can get to hear all the sessions and speakers of interest to me! I love that I can go from an in-depth scientific talk on mechanisms that mediate neuropathology, to talks on state-of-the-art brain imaging, through to talks on lived-experiences. It keeps me engaged and I come away having learnt so much.</em></p>

             <h3>Do you see any particular benefits of having the conference in Melbourne/ Australia?</h3>
             <p><em>This is a great way to showcase Melbourne and the excellent research that is coming out of Victoria and Australia. I really hope that the majority of international speakers and meeting attendees can come in person, because catching-up in person after a day’s talks is a wonderful opportunity to engage with established and new research friends.</em></p>

             <h3>Do you have any hobbies outside of your work?</h3>
             <p><em>Work takes up a lot of my time, but outside of work I like to relax with my husband and children, not look at emails and take our dog for a run.</em></p>

             <h3>What was your guilty COVID isolation pleasure?</h3>
             <p><em>Too much chocolate for sure…. And therefore needing to spend a lot more time running!</em></p>

             <h3 class="mt-0">What can delegates expect to hear from you?</h3>
             <p><em>I will be sharing insights from our work on personalized speech synthesis and implications for communication participation. I’ll also share early findings from related work in the area of social identity.</em></p>

             <h3>Highlight the international relevance of your work for delegates?</h3>
             <p><em>Over the past 6 years, we have recruited voice contributors from 120 countries. I’d like to discuss how crowdsourcing can be utilized to a greater extent to advance research and clinical practice.</em></p>

             <h3>What key messages will you have for community members and people with lived experience of child-onset disability?</h3>
             <p><em>The medical model of Speech and Language Pathology tends to focus on loss of function in comparison to typically development. I believe that child-onset disability alters almost every aspect of development not just the core area of impairment. There are compensatory skills that are learned and difficult to neatly separate from the impairment. I think that we could better serve this population by studying and treating their residual abilities rather than focus on how those skills differ from typical development.</em></p>

             <h3>What makes conferences such as this important?</h3>
             <p><em>Conferences such as this bring together researchers, clinicians, advocates, those living with communication impairment and others from different perspectives which is key to gaining a more comprehensive understanding of complex issues. It’s also amazing how conversations in between talks or at the breaks can provide key insights and lead to friendships and collaborations that last a lifetime.</em></p>

             <h3>What is the best piece of advice you could give a student or early career researcher who is attending their first big conference?</h3>
             <p><em>When you make a list of the presentations you want to see, make at least 10% in areas that you think you are not really interested in. I think we tend to close off our interests too early. You’ll be surprised that you’ll actually learn more in those sessions than attending talks in areas you are already passionate about. I would also spend time in the exhibit hall and the poster sessions because you often learn more when you can actively participate in the learning. Last, if there are particular people you want to meet, try to set that up ahead of time.</em></p>

             <h3>What are you most looking forward to at the Better Together 2022 Conference?</h3>
             <p><em>I am looking forward to learning more about how researchers and clinicians are thinking of incorporating advances in technology into their research/clinical practice. What are their hopes, fear and opportunities.</em></p>

             <h3>Do you see any particular benefits of having the conference in Melbourne/ Australia?</h3>
             <p><em>I haven’t been to Melbourne before but from what I understand, it’s a major city that is accessible and thus makes a perfect venue for this type of conference.  The University and local hospitals will also help to attract a critical mass for the meeting.</em></p>

             <h3>Do you have any hobbies outside of your work?</h3>
             <p><em>I love almost any form of art – painting, drawing, sculpture, cooking. I enjoy making art and enjoying that created by others.</em></p>

             <h3>What was your guilty COVID isolation pleasure?</h3>
             <p><em>I never used to watch TV. We don’t even have cable. But now, I find myself binging on Netflix every once in a while to escape the boredom of everyday life. It’s usually a binge session every couple weeks.</em></p>

              <h3 class="mt-0">What can delegates expect to hear from you?</h3>
              <p><em>I will be sharing my research from the United States, pertaining to health outcomes among adults with CP. I will specifically be discussing the state of the literature surrounding lifespan health and development for individuals living with CP, with specific attention given to the unique burden of preventable, noncommunicable diseases attributed to physical inactivity and aging in this population.</em></p>

               <h3>Highlight the international relevance of your work for delegates?</h3>
               <p><em>Although my work focuses on clinical and population-representative cohorts from the United States, our work is highly relevant to the growing adult CP population, globally. Improved clinical and public health infrastructure for screening, treating, and preventing chronic disease and mental health disorders is of international relevance.</em></p>

               <h3>What key messages will you have for community members and people with lived experience of child-onset disability?</h3>
               <p><em>Adults with CP and other childhood-onset disabilities consistently report feeling deserted by their health professionals when they are discharged from paediatric services, and struggle to access appropriate continuity of care when they begin experiencing declines in health and function as early as young adulthood. I will convey to community members and people with lived experience (or caregivers) to strongly advocate for themselves, and demand comprehensive preventive medicine screening</em></p> and/or referrals to specialists to identify risk for early-onset (and preventable) metabolic, cardiovascular, musculoskeletal diseases, as well as mental health disorders.

               <h3>What makes conferences such as this important?</h3>
               <p><em>Conferences such as this are so valuable to me. I greatly appreciate the opportunity to learn from my long-time and new friends and colleagues, as well as network and brainstorm future collaborations, visit and experience different cultures, seek adventures, and explore new places.</em></p>

               <p><em>I am really looking  forward to participating in the preconference workshop pertaining to Adults with CP. This will be the first time that so many experts will be able to share insights and international perspectives on this topic.</em></p>
