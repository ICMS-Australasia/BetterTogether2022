             <h2>Get to know Steve</h2>
             <h3 class="mt-0">What can delegates expect to hear from you?</h3>
             I intend to cover some historical aspects of development of Paediatric Rehabilitation services in Australasia, the importance of teams working together and present some thoughts about future development.

            <h3>Highlight the international relevance of your work for delegates?</h3>
            <p><em>It is hoped that the experiences in the development of Paediatric services in Australasia will be of some use to other areas of the world where these services are yet to be in place.</em></p>

            <h3>What key messages will you have for community members and people with lived experience of child-onset disability?</h3>
            <p><em>The message is that there is a group of well-trained trained professionals; therapists, nurses and doctors who are dedicated to sharing their knowledge in assisting you in the care for your child. You are not alone.</em></p>

            <h3>What makes conferences such as this important?</h3>
            <p><em>One of the ‘lessons” from the restrictions that Covid has taught is the importance of the collegiate experience of meeting with colleagues, sharing viewpoints and mixing socially. It is to be hoped that our meeting in 2022 will allow this to be re-introduced so we can all benefit from the interchange of information from the widespread group of attendees that the combined meeting will bring together.</em></p>

            <h3>What is the best piece of advice you could give a student or early career researcher who is attending their first big conference?</h3>
            <p><em>The clearest thing I remember from attending my first American Academy of CP meeting was not the information learned. It was unquestionably the people I met and with whom I have caught up with many times at subsequent meetings and in several cases have visited them and vice versa. Make yourself known. We’re a friendly lot.</em></p>

            <h3>What are you most looking forward to at the Better Together 2022 Conference?</h3>
            <p><em>The same as the above answer.</em></p>

            <h3>Do you see any particular benefits of having the conference in Melbourne/ Australia?</h3>
            <p><em>For the “second best” city in Australia it is still a wonderful place to visit! The food scene is fantastic – maybe even better than my home city of Sydney - and transport access is excellent with March being a great time to visit and enjoy the local hospitality.</em></p>

            <h3>Do you have any hobbies outside of your work?</h3>
            <p><em>I play golf – a lot; travel – a lot when Covid allows; socialise with friends and enjoy dining out and good wine.</em></p>

            <h3>What was your guilty COVID isolation pleasure?</h3>
            <p><em>Undisturbed reading – I did not feel too guilty though.</em></p>

             <h2>Get to know Gillian</h2>
             <h3 class="mt-0">What can delegates expect to hear from you?</h3>
              <p><em>A presentation that is grounded in the literature and highlights the importance of developing new ideas, the tools needed to explore these, and working with clinicians and knowledge translation specialists to move ideas into practice.</em></p>

              <h3>Highlight the international relevance of your work for delegates?</h3>
              <p><em>My work involves international collaborations with researchers in Canada, Australia, Sweden, and the United States.</em></p>

              <h3>What key messages will you have for community members and people with lived experience of child-onset disability?</h3>
              <p><em>A key message in most of my work is the importance of people’s beliefs about themselves, their relationships with others, and the things that give them a sense of energy and value in the world. We should not ignore the importance of expectations, assumptions, and values.</em></p>

              <h3>What makes conferences such as this important?</h3>
              <p><em>The key value to me is the coming together of like-minded people with similar interests. Conferences such as this serve to develop a ‘community of practice’ that embraces researchers, people with lived experience, clinicians, students, and educators.</em></p>

              <h3>What is the best piece of advice you could give a student or early career researcher who is attending their first big conference?</h3>
              <p><em>Try to meet as many people as possible, you never know what connections you may find in terms of shared interests.</em></p>

              <h3>What are you most looking forward to at the Better Together 2022 Conference?</h3>
              <p><em>Hopefully the COVID situation will have eased by March 2022. I am most looking forward to hearing new ideas and connecting with new people.</em></p>

              <h3>Do you see any particular benefits of having the conference in Melbourne/ Australia?</h3>
              <p><em>Yes! Melbourne is a lovely city filled with lots to do. I’ve been there before and would love to return. Check out the singing bridge! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4D_2ri_UEs" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4D_2ri_UEs</a>. The Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre is a state-of-the-art venue.</em></p>

              <h3>Do you have any hobbies outside of your work?</h3>
              <p><em>My hobbies include running, yoga, resistance training, and walking (keeping fit in general). I also love gardening and am an avid reader of mystery and science fiction books.</em></p>

              <h3>What was your guilty COVID isolation pleasure?</h3>
              <p><em>That would be potato chips or any salty, crunchy snack, they were my pre-COVID pleasure too!</em></p>

             <h2>Get to know Rick</h2>
             <h3 class="mt-0">What can delegates expect to hear from you?</h3>
             <p><em>A bit of review about “what we know” about muscle in cerebral palsy but also current and future opportunities for discovery and treatment in children with cerebral palsy.</em></p>

             <h3>Highlight the international relevance of your work for delegates?</h3>
             <p><em>I believe that our work is relevant to the world in that we are one of the few laboratories in the world working on actual skeletal muscle from children with cerebral palsy rather than working on animal models.  The work is slower, because it requires human subjects research, but we believe that it is extremely relevant and offers the promise for development of future therapeutics.</em></p>

             <h3>What key messages will you have for community members and people with lived experience of child-onset disability?</h3>
             <p><em>There is great hope for the future to help kids with cerebral palsy.  We have new sets of powerful tools, are more closely aligned in purpose, and have better communication than ever.  We are here to help!</em></p>

             <h3>What makes conferences such as this important?</h3>
             <p><em>It is rare for investigators with such diverse backgrounds to gather around a single purpose—helping our patients with cerebral palsy and working toward their improved lives.  Typically, we gather with folks of the same discipline, not those trying to solve the same problem!</em></p>

             <h3>What is the best piece of advice you could give a student or early career researcher who is attending their first big conference?</h3>
             <p><em>Follow your passion and intentionally link your cart to great mentors.</em></p>

             <h3>What are you most looking forward to at the Better Together 2022 Conference?</h3>
             <p><em>I love spending time with my international colleagues and to vibrant and open discussions related to important topics in cerebral palsy patients.</em></p>

             <h3>Do you see any particular benefits of having the conference in Melbourne/ Australia?</h3>
             <p><em>We have to intentionally get away since it’ such a long trip for everyone.  As a result we probably will not have folks coming in just for a day.  Thus, we can have long and sustained interactions that should lead to new collaborations and experiments.</em></p>

             <h3>Do you have any hobbies outside of your work?</h3>
             <p><em>I am an avid runner and love playing guitar alone or with friends.  I am also an avid sports fan!</em></p>

             <h3>What was your guilty COVID isolation pleasure?</h3>
             <p><em>I am boring. I read some great books!</em></p>

             <h2>Get to know Susan</h2>
             <h3 class="mt-0">What can delegates expect to hear from you?</h3>
             <p><em>A new way of thinking about behaviour and how to change it, both in relation to professionals and in relation to those they are providing a service to. Relevant resources are on the <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/behaviour-change/" target="_blank">Centre for Behaviour Change website</a>.</em></p>

             <h3>Highlight the international relevance of your work for delegates?</h3>
             <p><em>The Behaviour Change Wheel guide to developing interventions is my most widely read book. A user-friendly version is available <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/behaviour-change/resources/achieving-behaviour-change-guides-government" target="_blank">free</a>.</em></p>

             <h3>What key messages will you have for community members and people with lived experience of child-onset disability?</h3>
             <p><em>Understanding behaviour and how to change it is of potential use for everyone – in relation to enabling others and thinking about one’s own situation.</em></p>

             <h3>What makes conferences such as this important?</h3>
             <p><em>After the global pandemic, conferences where people can be together in person, sharing the same experiences, networking over drinks and meals and discussing issues in the same room will be a great treat.</em></p>

             <h3>What is the best piece of advice you could give a student or early career researcher who is attending their first big conference?</h3>
             <p><em>Don’t be afraid to go up to speakers or anyone else and talk to them – conferences are about networking and my favourite conferences are those where first year students and Professors talk (and even dance) with each other.</em></p>

             <h3>What are you most looking forward to at the Better Together 2022 Conference?</h3>
             <p><em>Getting to know something of a scientific and professional organisation that is new to me and meeting new people doing important work.</em></p>

             <h3>Do you see any particular benefits of having the conference in Melbourne/ Australia?</h3>
             <p><em>I have been to many cities in Australia and Melbourne remains my favourite – coming from London, diversity and celebrating diversity in all forms including culturally, are important.</em></p>

             <h3>Do you have any hobbies outside of your work?</h3>
             <p><em>Tennis, yoga, walking, cryptic crosswords, playing with my grandchildren</em></p>

             <h3>What was your guilty COVID isolation pleasure?</h3>
             <p><em>I don’t do guilt, such an unhelpful emotion! Putting my camera off and do what I want to do during boring meetings was fun.</em></p>

             <h2>Get to know Rupal</h2>

             <h3 class="mt-0">What can delegates expect to hear from you?</h3>
             <p><em>I will be sharing insights from our work on personalized speech synthesis and implications for communication participation. I’ll also share early findings from related work in the area of social identity.</em></p>

             <h3>Highlight the international relevance of your work for delegates?</h3>
             <p><em>Over the past 6 years, we have recruited voice contributors from 120 countries. I’d like to discuss how crowdsourcing can be utilized to a greater extent to advance research and clinical practice.</em></p>

             <h3>What key messages will you have for community members and people with lived experience of child-onset disability?</h3>
             <p><em>The medical model of Speech and Language Pathology tends to focus on loss of function in comparison to typically development. I believe that child-onset disability alters almost every aspect of development not just the core area of impairment. There are compensatory skills that are learned and difficult to neatly separate from the impairment. I think that we could better serve this population by studying and treating their residual abilities rather than focus on how those skills differ from typical development.</em></p>

             <h3>What makes conferences such as this important?</h3>
             <p><em>Conferences such as this bring together researchers, clinicians, advocates, those living with communication impairment and others from different perspectives which is key to gaining a more comprehensive understanding of complex issues. It’s also amazing how conversations in between talks or at the breaks can provide key insights and lead to friendships and collaborations that last a lifetime.</em></p>

             <h3>What is the best piece of advice you could give a student or early career researcher who is attending their first big conference?</h3>
             <p><em>When you make a list of the presentations you want to see, make at least 10% in areas that you think you are not really interested in. I think we tend to close off our interests too early. You’ll be surprised that you’ll actually learn more in those sessions than attending talks in areas you are already passionate about. I would also spend time in the exhibit hall and the poster sessions because you often learn more when you can actively participate in the learning. Last, if there are particular people you want to meet, try to set that up ahead of time.</em></p>

             <h3>What are you most looking forward to at the Better Together 2022 Conference?</h3>
             <p><em>I am looking forward to learning more about how researchers and clinicians are thinking of incorporating advances in technology into their research/clinical practice. What are their hopes, fear and opportunities.</em></p>

             <h3>Do you see any particular benefits of having the conference in Melbourne/ Australia?</h3>
             <p><em>I haven’t been to Melbourne before but from what I understand, it’s a major city that is accessible and thus makes a perfect venue for this type of conference.  The University and local hospitals will also help to attract a critical mass for the meeting.</em></p>

             <h3>Do you have any hobbies outside of your work?</h3>
             <p><em>I love almost any form of art – painting, drawing, sculpture, cooking. I enjoy making art and enjoying that created by others.</em></p>

             <h3>What was your guilty COVID isolation pleasure?</h3>
             <p><em>I never used to watch TV. We don’t even have cable. But now, I find myself binging on Netflix every once in a while to escape the boredom of everyday life. It’s usually a binge session every couple weeks.</em></p>

             <h2>Get to know Mark</h2>

              <h3 class="mt-0">What can delegates expect to hear from you?</h3>
              <p><em>I will be sharing my research from the United States, pertaining to health outcomes among adults with CP. I will specifically be discussing the state of the literature surrounding lifespan health and development for individuals living with CP, with specific attention given to the unique burden of preventable, noncommunicable diseases attributed to physical inactivity and aging in this population.</em></p>

               <h3>Highlight the international relevance of your work for delegates?</h3>
               <p><em>Although my work focuses on clinical and population-representative cohorts from the United States, our work is highly relevant to the growing adult CP population, globally. Improved clinical and public health infrastructure for screening, treating, and preventing chronic disease and mental health disorders is of international relevance.</em></p>

               <h3>What key messages will you have for community members and people with lived experience of child-onset disability?</h3>
               <p><em>Adults with CP and other childhood-onset disabilities consistently report feeling deserted by their health professionals when they are discharged from paediatric services, and struggle to access appropriate continuity of care when they begin experiencing declines in health and function as early as young adulthood. I will convey to community members and people with lived experience (or caregivers) to strongly advocate for themselves, and demand comprehensive preventive medicine screening</em></p> and/or referrals to specialists to identify risk for early-onset (and preventable) metabolic, cardiovascular, musculoskeletal diseases, as well as mental health disorders.
