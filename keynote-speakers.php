 <p>Dr Steve O’Flaherty is a Rehabilitation Paediatrician who has worked with children for over 50 years. Originally from New Zealand he completed consultant training at Sydney Children’s Hospital and then worked as the community Paediatrician for western Sydney. From the late 1980s he was head of the Paediatric Rehabilitation department at Westmead Hospital until 1995 when all Paediatric services moved to the Children’s Hospital at Westmead where he was the inaugural head of Paediatric Rehabilitation (Kids Rehab) for 17 years. He oversaw the introduction in Australia of training of Paediatric advanced trainees in Paediatric Rehabilitation. This avoided the previous need to travel overseas for training. Such training is now offered in all Paediatric Rehab services around Australia. From this a cohort of trained consultants has developed and has facilitated the staffing of units in Australia and NZ. Amongst other things and with his colleagues he oversaw the introduction at Kids Rehab of Botulinum Toxin, Intrathecal Baclofen, Selective Dorsal Rhisotomy and Deep Brain Stimulation treatment options for managing movement disability especially in children with CP and he was part of the team that facilitated relocation of the Paediatric Gait Lab to CHW. He continues clinical work with children with CP as a senior Staff Specialist in Paediatric Rehabilitation at Sydney Children’s Hospital. </p>

             <h2>Get to know Steve</h2>
             <h3 class="mt-0">What can delegates expect to hear from you?</h3>
             I intend to cover some historical aspects of development of Paediatric Rehabilitation services in Australasia, the importance of teams working together and present some thoughts about future development.

            <h3>Highlight the international relevance of your work for delegates?</h3>
            <p><em>It is hoped that the experiences in the development of Paediatric services in Australasia will be of some use to other areas of the world where these services are yet to be in place.</em></p>

            <h3>What key messages will you have for community members and people with lived experience of child-onset disability?</h3>
            <p><em>The message is that there is a group of well-trained trained professionals; therapists, nurses and doctors who are dedicated to sharing their knowledge in assisting you in the care for your child. You are not alone.</em></p>

            <h3>What makes conferences such as this important?</h3>
            <p><em>One of the ‘lessons” from the restrictions that Covid has taught is the importance of the collegiate experience of meeting with colleagues, sharing viewpoints and mixing socially. It is to be hoped that our meeting in 2022 will allow this to be re-introduced so we can all benefit from the interchange of information from the widespread group of attendees that the combined meeting will bring together.</em></p>

            <h3>What is the best piece of advice you could give a student or early career researcher who is attending their first big conference?</h3>
            <p><em>The clearest thing I remember from attending my first American Academy of CP meeting was not the information learned. It was unquestionably the people I met and with whom I have caught up with many times at subsequent meetings and in several cases have visited them and vice versa. Make yourself known. We’re a friendly lot.</em></p>

            <h3>What are you most looking forward to at the Better Together 2022 Conference?</h3>
            <p><em>The same as the above answer.</em></p>

            <h3>Do you see any particular benefits of having the conference in Melbourne/ Australia?</h3>
            <p><em>For the “second best” city in Australia it is still a wonderful place to visit! The food scene is fantastic – maybe even better than my home city of Sydney - and transport access is excellent with March being a great time to visit and enjoy the local hospitality.</em></p>

            <h3>Do you have any hobbies outside of your work?</h3>
            <p><em>I play golf – a lot; travel – a lot when Covid allows; socialise with friends and enjoy dining out and good wine.</em></p>

            <h3>What was your guilty COVID isolation pleasure?</h3>
            <p><em>Undisturbed reading – I did not feel too guilty though.</em></p>

             <h2>Get to know Gillian</h2>
             <h3 class="mt-0">What can delegates expect to hear from you?</h3>
              <p><em>A presentation that is grounded in the literature and highlights the importance of developing new ideas, the tools needed to explore these, and working with clinicians and knowledge translation specialists to move ideas into practice.</em></p>

              <h3>Highlight the international relevance of your work for delegates?</h3>
              <p><em>My work involves international collaborations with researchers in Canada, Australia, Sweden, and the United States.</em></p>

              <h3>What key messages will you have for community members and people with lived experience of child-onset disability?</h3>
              <p><em>A key message in most of my work is the importance of people’s beliefs about themselves, their relationships with others, and the things that give them a sense of energy and value in the world. We should not ignore the importance of expectations, assumptions, and values.</em></p>

              <h3>What makes conferences such as this important?</h3>
              <p><em>The key value to me is the coming together of like-minded people with similar interests. Conferences such as this serve to develop a ‘community of practice’ that embraces researchers, people with lived experience, clinicians, students, and educators.</em></p>

              <h3>What is the best piece of advice you could give a student or early career researcher who is attending their first big conference?</h3>
              <p><em>Try to meet as many people as possible, you never know what connections you may find in terms of shared interests.</em></p>

              <h3>What are you most looking forward to at the Better Together 2022 Conference?</h3>
              <p><em>Hopefully the COVID situation will have eased by March 2022. I am most looking forward to hearing new ideas and connecting with new people.</em></p>

              <h3>Do you see any particular benefits of having the conference in Melbourne/ Australia?</h3>
              <p><em>Yes! Melbourne is a lovely city filled with lots to do. I’ve been there before and would love to return. Check out the singing bridge! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4D_2ri_UEs" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4D_2ri_UEs</a>. The Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre is a state-of-the-art venue.</em></p>

              <h3>Do you have any hobbies outside of your work?</h3>
              <p><em>My hobbies include running, yoga, resistance training, and walking (keeping fit in general). I also love gardening and am an avid reader of mystery and science fiction books.</em></p>

              <h3>What was your guilty COVID isolation pleasure?</h3>
              <p><em>That would be potato chips or any salty, crunchy snack, they were my pre-COVID pleasure too!</em></p>

             <h2>Get to know Susan</h2>
             <h3 class="mt-0">What can delegates expect to hear from you?</h3>
             <p><em>A new way of thinking about behaviour and how to change it, both in relation to professionals and in relation to those they are providing a service to. Relevant resources are on the <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/behaviour-change/" target="_blank">Centre for Behaviour Change website</a>.</em></p>

             <h3>Highlight the international relevance of your work for delegates?</h3>
             <p><em>The Behaviour Change Wheel guide to developing interventions is my most widely read book. A user-friendly version is available <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/behaviour-change/resources/achieving-behaviour-change-guides-government" target="_blank">free</a>.</em></p>

             <h3>What key messages will you have for community members and people with lived experience of child-onset disability?</h3>
             <p><em>Understanding behaviour and how to change it is of potential use for everyone – in relation to enabling others and thinking about one’s own situation.</em></p>

             <h3>What makes conferences such as this important?</h3>
             <p><em>After the global pandemic, conferences where people can be together in person, sharing the same experiences, networking over drinks and meals and discussing issues in the same room will be a great treat.</em></p>

             <h3>What is the best piece of advice you could give a student or early career researcher who is attending their first big conference?</h3>
             <p><em>Don’t be afraid to go up to speakers or anyone else and talk to them – conferences are about networking and my favourite conferences are those where first year students and Professors talk (and even dance) with each other.</em></p>

             <h3>What are you most looking forward to at the Better Together 2022 Conference?</h3>
             <p><em>Getting to know something of a scientific and professional organisation that is new to me and meeting new people doing important work.</em></p>

             <h3>Do you see any particular benefits of having the conference in Melbourne/ Australia?</h3>
             <p><em>I have been to many cities in Australia and Melbourne remains my favourite – coming from London, diversity and celebrating diversity in all forms including culturally, are important.</em></p>

             <h3>Do you have any hobbies outside of your work?</h3>
             <p><em>Tennis, yoga, walking, cryptic crosswords, playing with my grandchildren</em></p>

             <h3>What was your guilty COVID isolation pleasure?</h3>
             <p><em>I don’t do guilt, such an unhelpful emotion! Putting my camera off and do what I want to do during boring meetings was fun.</em></p>

             <h2>Get to know Mark</h2>

              <h3 class="mt-0">What can delegates expect to hear from you?</h3>
              <p><em>I will be sharing my research from the United States, pertaining to health outcomes among adults with CP. I will specifically be discussing the state of the literature surrounding lifespan health and development for individuals living with CP, with specific attention given to the unique burden of preventable, noncommunicable diseases attributed to physical inactivity and aging in this population.</em></p>

               <h3>Highlight the international relevance of your work for delegates?</h3>
               <p><em>Although my work focuses on clinical and population-representative cohorts from the United States, our work is highly relevant to the growing adult CP population, globally. Improved clinical and public health infrastructure for screening, treating, and preventing chronic disease and mental health disorders is of international relevance.</em></p>

               <h3>What key messages will you have for community members and people with lived experience of child-onset disability?</h3>
               <p><em>Adults with CP and other childhood-onset disabilities consistently report feeling deserted by their health professionals when they are discharged from paediatric services, and struggle to access appropriate continuity of care when they begin experiencing declines in health and function as early as young adulthood. I will convey to community members and people with lived experience (or caregivers) to strongly advocate for themselves, and demand comprehensive preventive medicine screening</em></p> and/or referrals to specialists to identify risk for early-onset (and preventable) metabolic, cardiovascular, musculoskeletal diseases, as well as mental health disorders.

               <h3>What makes conferences such as this important?</h3>
               <p><em>Conferences such as this are so valuable to me. I greatly appreciate the opportunity to learn from my long-time and new friends and colleagues, as well as network and brainstorm future collaborations, visit and experience different cultures, seek adventures, and explore new places.</em></p>

               <h3>What is the best piece of advice you could give a student or early career researcher who is attending their first big conference?</h3>
               <p><em>Connect with other attendees and network as much as possible. Don’t be afraid to reach out to senior investigators… everyone is excited to help.</em></p>

               <h3>What are you most looking forward to at the Better Together 2022 Conference?</h3>
               <p><em>I am really looking  forward to participating in the preconference workshop pertaining to Adults with CP. This will be the first time that so many experts will be able to share insights and international perspectives on this topic.</em></p>

               <h3>Do you see any particular benefits of having the conference in Melbourne/ Australia?</h3>
               <p><em>Yes! I’ve never been to Melbourne, Australia! I cannot wait to explore and meet new people!</em></p>

               <h3>Do you have any hobbies outside of your work?</h3>
               <p><em>Yes! I enjoy my daily exercise routine, as well as regular outdoor recreation such as hiking, biking, running, and kayaking!</em></p>

               <h3>What was your guilty COVID isolation pleasure?</h3>
               <p><em>I look forward to my daily Amazon and/or Zappos deliveries.</em></p>

             <h3 class="mt-0">What can delegates expect to hear from you?</h3>
             <p><em>I generally talk about how disabled people can feel good about themselves, and how health professionals can support them in that.  I am sure I will get more specific as the date draws closer!  We may be living in a very different world by then.</em></p>

              <h3>Highlight the international relevance of your work for delegates?</h3>
              <p><em>I have researched in Africa and Asia as well as in UK, so I am aware of the differences for low, middle and high income country settings.  The need to change attitudes towards people with disabilities is common across the board.</em></p>

              <h3>What key messages will you have for community members and people with lived experience of child-onset disability?</h3>
              <p><em>Collaborating with good academics is worth doing.  It will grow your skills and insights and confidence.  Working with professionals is all about good partnerships.</em></p>

              <h3>What makes conferences such as this important?</h3>
