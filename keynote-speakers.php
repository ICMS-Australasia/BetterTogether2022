             <h2>Get to know Gillian</h2>
             <h3 class="mt-0">What can delegates expect to hear from you?</h3>
              <p><em>A presentation that is grounded in the literature and highlights the importance of developing new ideas, the tools needed to explore these, and working with clinicians and knowledge translation specialists to move ideas into practice.</em></p>

              <h3>Highlight the international relevance of your work for delegates?</h3>
              <p><em>My work involves international collaborations with researchers in Canada, Australia, Sweden, and the United States.</em></p>

              <h3>What key messages will you have for community members and people with lived experience of child-onset disability?</h3>
              <p><em>A key message in most of my work is the importance of people’s beliefs about themselves, their relationships with others, and the things that give them a sense of energy and value in the world. We should not ignore the importance of expectations, assumptions, and values.</em></p>

              <h3>What makes conferences such as this important?</h3>
              <p><em>The key value to me is the coming together of like-minded people with similar interests. Conferences such as this serve to develop a ‘community of practice’ that embraces researchers, people with lived experience, clinicians, students, and educators.</em></p>

              <h3>What is the best piece of advice you could give a student or early career researcher who is attending their first big conference?</h3>
              <p><em>Try to meet as many people as possible, you never know what connections you may find in terms of shared interests.</em></p>

              <h3>What are you most looking forward to at the Better Together 2022 Conference?</h3>
              <p><em>Hopefully the COVID situation will have eased by March 2022. I am most looking forward to hearing new ideas and connecting with new people.</em></p>

              <h3>Do you see any particular benefits of having the conference in Melbourne/ Australia?</h3>
              <p><em>Yes! Melbourne is a lovely city filled with lots to do. I’ve been there before and would love to return. Check out the singing bridge! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4D_2ri_UEs" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4D_2ri_UEs</a>. The Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre is a state-of-the-art venue.</em></p>

              <h3>Do you have any hobbies outside of your work?</h3>
              <p><em>My hobbies include running, yoga, resistance training, and walking (keeping fit in general). I also love gardening and am an avid reader of mystery and science fiction books.</em></p>

              <h3>What was your guilty COVID isolation pleasure?</h3>
              <p><em>That would be potato chips or any salty, crunchy snack, they were my pre-COVID pleasure too!</em></p>

             <h2>Get to know Mark</h2>

              <h3 class="mt-0">What can delegates expect to hear from you?</h3>
              <p><em>I will be sharing my research from the United States, pertaining to health outcomes among adults with CP. I will specifically be discussing the state of the literature surrounding lifespan health and development for individuals living with CP, with specific attention given to the unique burden of preventable, noncommunicable diseases attributed to physical inactivity and aging in this population.</em></p>

               <h3>Highlight the international relevance of your work for delegates?</h3>
               <p><em>Although my work focuses on clinical and population-representative cohorts from the United States, our work is highly relevant to the growing adult CP population, globally. Improved clinical and public health infrastructure for screening, treating, and preventing chronic disease and mental health disorders is of international relevance.</em></p>

               <h3>What key messages will you have for community members and people with lived experience of child-onset disability?</h3>
               <p><em>Adults with CP and other childhood-onset disabilities consistently report feeling deserted by their health professionals when they are discharged from paediatric services, and struggle to access appropriate continuity of care when they begin experiencing declines in health and function as early as young adulthood. I will convey to community members and people with lived experience (or caregivers) to strongly advocate for themselves, and demand comprehensive preventive medicine screening</em></p> and/or referrals to specialists to identify risk for early-onset (and preventable) metabolic, cardiovascular, musculoskeletal diseases, as well as mental health disorders.

               <h3>What makes conferences such as this important?</h3>
               <p><em>Conferences such as this are so valuable to me. I greatly appreciate the opportunity to learn from my long-time and new friends and colleagues, as well as network and brainstorm future collaborations, visit and experience different cultures, seek adventures, and explore new places.</em></p>

               <h3>What is the best piece of advice you could give a student or early career researcher who is attending their first big conference?</h3>
               <p><em>Connect with other attendees and network as much as possible. Don’t be afraid to reach out to senior investigators… everyone is excited to help.</em></p>

               <h3>What are you most looking forward to at the Better Together 2022 Conference?</h3>
               <p><em>I am really looking  forward to participating in the preconference workshop pertaining to Adults with CP. This will be the first time that so many experts will be able to share insights and international perspectives on this topic.</em></p>

               <h3>Do you see any particular benefits of having the conference in Melbourne/ Australia?</h3>
               <p><em>Yes! I’ve never been to Melbourne, Australia! I cannot wait to explore and meet new people!</em></p>

               <h3>Do you have any hobbies outside of your work?</h3>
               <p><em>Yes! I enjoy my daily exercise routine, as well as regular outdoor recreation such as hiking, biking, running, and kayaking!</em></p>

               <h3>What was your guilty COVID isolation pleasure?</h3>
               <p><em>I look forward to my daily Amazon and/or Zappos deliveries.</em></p>

             <h2>Get to know Tom</h2>
             <h3 class="mt-0">What can delegates expect to hear from you?</h3>
             <p><em>I generally talk about how disabled people can feel good about themselves, and how health professionals can support them in that.  I am sure I will get more specific as the date draws closer!  We may be living in a very different world by then.</em></p>

              <h3>Highlight the international relevance of your work for delegates?</h3>
              <p><em>I have researched in Africa and Asia as well as in UK, so I am aware of the differences for low, middle and high income country settings.  The need to change attitudes towards people with disabilities is common across the board.</em></p>

              <h3>What key messages will you have for community members and people with lived experience of child-onset disability?</h3>
              <p><em>Collaborating with good academics is worth doing.  It will grow your skills and insights and confidence.  Working with professionals is all about good partnerships.</em></p>

              <h3>What makes conferences such as this important?</h3>
              <p><em>Conferences are a great way of getting an overview of a field, of networking with your peers, and trying out your ideas.</em></p>

              <h3>What is the best piece of advice you could give a student or early career researcher who is attending their first big conference?</h3>
              <p><em>Talk to strangers – networking is what it’s all about.</em></p>

              <h3>Do you see any particular benefits of having the conference in Melbourne/ Australia?</h3>
              <p><em>It’s a lovely place, excellent food, and you might get to see some footy!</em></p>

              <h3>Do you have any hobbies outside of your work?</h3>
              <p><em>Art and culture, good food, and creative writing.</em></p>

              <h3>What was your guilty COVID isolation pleasure?</h3>
              <p><em>Cheese.</em></p>
