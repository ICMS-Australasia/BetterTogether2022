<h2>Invitation and registration to attend the event.</h2>
 <p>Although this is a separate process to lodging your visa application, when assessing whether you meet the criteria for the grant of a visa, the department may take into account whether you are registered or were invited to attend the event.</p>
 <p>Confirmation of registration, or a copy of your letter of invitation, should accompany visa applications. For online subclass 400 and subclass 600 applications, information about documents that need to be attached will be provided as part of the application process. Your letter of invitation will be sent to you with your registration successful letter.</p>

<h2>Things to consider before lodging an application</h2>
<h3>Health and Character Requirements</h3>
 <p>All visa applicants must be assessed against Australia’s health and character requirements. These requirements are designed to protect the safety and security of the Australian community.</p>
<h4>Health requirements</h4>
<p>As part of the visa application process you may be required to undertake a medical examination, chest x ray and/or other health checks.</p>
<p>The Department of Immigration and Border Protection (the department) will advise you of the applicable health checks (if any), based on your individual circumstances.</p>

<p>If you are unsure whether you satisfy the character requirements because of prior criminal convictions, you should lodge a paper-based application at the Australian visa office nearest to your current place of residence, at least four months prior to the event start date.</p>
<p>Contact information for Australian visa offices is available on the department’s website.</p>

<h2>Obligations of visa holders</h2>

<p>You must comply with your visa validity and visa conditions while in Australia.

You are advised to carry this visa grant notice when travelling for your own reference.</p>
<p>Your visa may be cancelled if you breach any of the conditions.</p>
<p>If your visa expires while you are still in Australia, you become an unlawful non-citizen. Unlawful non-citizens are liable to be detained and removed from Australia.</p>
