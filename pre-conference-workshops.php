The day will include discussion on implementation strategies, statistical challenges and future research opportunities.</p>



<hr>





 <p>There are two half day pre-conference sessions, delegates can select to attend both the AM and PM session to create a full day program if they wish.</p>

 <p><b>Let’s get strategic about physical activity participation for people with disability across the lifespan</b></p>

 <p><em>Sian Williams, Gaela Kilgour, Olaf Verschuren, Sarah Reedman, Nora Shields, and Jan Willem Gorter</em></p>

 <p>This symposium will focus on a lifespan and all abilities approach to promote 24 hour activity guidelines including sleep in people with disability. Panellists will discuss health and wellbeing benefits of physical activity, behaviour change as relevant for clinicians, and participation as a key to achieve sustained lifelong benefits.</p>



<hr>



 <p><b>Preclinical studies, neuroprotection, prevention and neural repair</b></p>

 <p><em>MinYoung Kim, Suzie Miller, Iona Novak, Kylie Crompton, So Yoon Ah, Atul Malhorta, Madison Paton, Megan Finch Edmonson,</em></p>

 <p>Cell-based therapies have neuroprotective and neuroregenerative potential for perinatal brain injury. This symposium brings together international experts to provide a status update on clinical trials for cell therapies, and how neuroprotective efficacy might be enhanced. We will also examine what is on the horizon for novel therapies particularly aimed at the preterm brain</p>



<hr>



 <p><b>Early Detection of cerebral palsy - experiences and challenges</b></p>

 <p><em>Cath Morgan, Iona Novak, Atul Malhotra, Esther Tantsis, Dr Samanmali Sumanasena, Sian Williams</em></p>

 <p>International Guidelines on early detection of cerebral palsy have been available for the past 5 years and have seen changes in practice globally. In this workshop, global experiences of translation will be discussed. Examples of clinical conundrums and implementation challenges faced by clinicians in the early diagnosis of CP will be presented.</p>



<hr>



 <p><b>Selective Dorsal Rhizotomy experiences around the world</b></p>

 <p><em>Nelleke Langerak, Tom Novachek, Nico Enslin, Kristian Aquilina, Simon Paget, Marcie Ward</em></p>

 <p>This will be a global, multidisciplinary course reviewing selective dorsal rhizotomy (SDR) including: spasticity management overview, SDR techniques, practices and experiences, post-operative management, policies and services, short-and long-term outcomes, and future of SDR. We aim to help clinicians and caregivers of children with spastic CP with their management plan.</p>

 <p>The below pre-conference sessions are 90-minutes long, mix and match one AM and one PM to make your own custom half-day pre-conference session.</p>



 <p><b><u>AM Symposia</u></b></p>

 <p>The following AM Symposia will run concurrently from 8:30am – 10:00am (AEDT), please select to attend only one from the online registration form</p>



 <p><b>Exploring inequities in service provision for Indigenous and First Nations women, their babies and children with cerebral palsy</b></p>

 <p><em>Alexandra Sorhage, Danny DeLore, Tan Martin, Juanita Sherwood, Michael Shevell, Anna Mackey, Sian Williams, Hayley Smithers-Sheedy, Sarah McIntyre, Sue Woolfenden</em></p>

 <p>This symposium will identify success stories and areas of continuing inequity for First Nations’ people with cerebral palsy (CP). Participants will be encouraged to discuss and reflect on reasons for and approaches to addressing potential inequity within their own work, and will leave with ideas to apply within their own context.</p>



<hr>



 <p><b>Implementation, challenges and impact of four parent-delivered training programmes for children with developmental disabilities in lower and middle income countries (LMIC)</b></p>

 <p><em>Hans Forssberg, Gillian Saloojee, Rachel Lassman, Katherine Benfer, Pamela Dixon</em></p>

 <p>This symposium focuses on the implementation of four parent-led training programmes for children with developmental disabilities living in resource-constrained settings. Presenters will describe the training, implementation and outcomes of each programme. This will be followed by a discussion how challenges common to all programmes were addressed.</p>

 <p><b>Cultural influences on early screening and intervention for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander infants at risk of Neurodevelopmental Disabilities</b></p>

 <p><em>Kath Benfer, Marjad Page, Dianne Shanley, Leann Ramsamy, Carly Luke</em></p>

 <p>Little is known about the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander construct of disability. This understanding has significant implications for how First Nations communities engage with child development and disability services, including screening and ‘intervention’ programs. With greater awareness of the importance of earlier screening and intervention based on the International Clinical Practice Guideline (Novak 2017), combined with increasing availability of disability services under NDIS, it is pertinent to focus on the role of culture in such programs.</p>
